# Private Banking Decline

*The structural erosion of Switzerland's core advantage.*

## The Traditional Model

Swiss private banking historically offered:

| Service | Value Proposition |
|---------|-------------------|
| Secrecy | Protection from home-country authorities |
| Stability | Neutral, politically stable jurisdiction |
| Relationship management | Personal service for wealthy clients |
| Discretion | Cultural commitment to privacy |
| Expertise | Generations of wealth management experience |

## Why the Model is Dying

### Secrecy Erosion

| Development | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| FATCA (US) | Forced disclosure of American accounts |
| CRS (OECD) | Automatic exchange of tax information |
| International pressure | Reduced differentiation |

Secrecy advantages have eroded under sustained international pressure.

### AI Replacement

| Function | AI Capability |
|----------|---------------|
| Portfolio management | Superior at scale |
| Risk assessment | More consistent |
| Client reporting | Automated |
| Compliance | More thorough |
| Recommendations | Data-driven |

Relationship managers are being replaced by AI systems that:
- Cost less
- Make fewer errors
- Scale infinitely
- Never leave for competitors

### Alternative Finance

| Alternative | Advantage Over Swiss Banking |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| Crypto custody | True self-sovereignty |
| DeFi protocols | No intermediary required |
| US platforms | Scale, technology, lower fees |
| Singapore | Asian market access |

## The Trajectory

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 2025-2028 | Accelerating headcount reduction |
| 2029-2032 | Business model transformation attempts |
| 2033-2036 | Swiss private banking substantially diminished |
