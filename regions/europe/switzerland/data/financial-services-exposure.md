# Switzerland Financial Services Exposure

*The structural dependence on vulnerable sectors.*

## Sectoral Weight

| Sector | GDP Share | Employment | AI Vulnerability |
|--------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| Financial services | ~10% | Significant | High |
| Private banking | Concentrated | High-income | High |
| Wealth management | Concentrated | High-income | High |
| Insurance | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |

Switzerland's economy is heavily weighted toward financial services, private banking, and high-end professional services—precisely the sectors most vulnerable to AI automation and alternative finance disruption.

## Private Banking Model

The traditional Swiss private banking model faces structural challenge:

| Factor | Historical Advantage | Current Status |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| Banking secrecy | Strong | Eroded |
| Relationship managers | Premium service | Replaceable by AI |
| Discretion | Valued | Less differentiating |
| Neutral jurisdiction | Valuable | Alternatives emerging |

## Wealth Migration

| Trend | Direction |
|-------|-----------|
| To crypto custody | Increasing |
| To decentralised alternatives | Increasing |
| To US platforms | Increasing |
| To Asian hubs | Increasing |

Wealth is moving toward:
- AI-enabled platforms with lower fees
- Crypto custody and DeFi
- Alternative jurisdictions with different advantages
