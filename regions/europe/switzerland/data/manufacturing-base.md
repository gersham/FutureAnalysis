# Switzerland Manufacturing Base

*The buffer against complete financial services dependence.*

## Key Sectors

| Sector | Global Position | AI Vulnerability |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Pharmaceuticals | World-class (Novartis, Roche) | Lower |
| Precision manufacturing | Strong | Moderate |
| Watchmaking | Dominant | Lower |
| Medical devices | Significant | Lower |

## Why This Matters

Switzerland is not solely dependent on financial services:

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Pharma employment | Substantial, relatively stable |
| Export value | Significant portion of GDP |
| Innovation capacity | High |
| Global competitiveness | Maintained |

## Offset Capacity

The manufacturing base provides partial buffer against financial services decline:

| Scenario | Manufacturing Effect |
|----------|---------------------|
| Financial services -30% | Manufacturing provides partial employment offset |
| Complete financial collapse | Manufacturing insufficient to prevent decline |

## Limitations

Manufacturing cannot fully compensate for financial services decline because:
- Financial services has higher GDP contribution
- Wealth effect from finance supports other sectors
- Real estate values tied to financial sector
- Tax base heavily weighted to finance
