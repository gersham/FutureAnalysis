## December 2025 Reality

Russia's economy is bifurcating—war sectors boom while civilian economy decays:

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **GDP growth 2025** | 1.9% (down from 4.3% in 2024) |
| **Technical recession** | Q1-Q2 2025 (sequential contraction) |
| **Military budget 2025** | $145 billion (6.31% of GDP, +25%) |
| **Civilian research cuts** | R$458B (2024) → R$260B (2026) |
| **Nvidia GPU accumulation** | ~9,000 total (vs Microsoft's 500,000 in 2024 alone) |
| **Global AI ranking** | 31st of 83 countries |

**War economy trap**: High-tech sectors giving way to labor-intensive, low-productivity industries. "Reverse industrialization."

Russia presents a case of structural decline masked by war-economy statistics. Official GDP growth, while positive, reflects military production rather than economic health. The civilian economy is stagnating, technology isolation is deepening, and the AI gap with competitors widens monthly. This is not the decline of an economy that can recover through policy adjustment—it is the decline of an economy being systematically excluded from the technological future.

The war economy trap is now visible. Military spending increased 25% to $145 billion (6.31% of GDP) while civilian research budgets are being cut by nearly half. War-related incomes drive consumer demand, creating inflation and masking underlying weakness. Russia's Prime Minister claims GDP grew 10% over three years—but this "growth" is concentrated in sectors that destroy rather than create value.

Technology isolation creates permanent capability damage. US and EU sanctions have cut Russia off from advanced semiconductors, GPUs, and AI infrastructure. Sberbank—Russia's technology leader—has accumulated approximately 9,000 GPUs since February 2022. For comparison, Microsoft purchased nearly 500,000 GPUs in 2024 alone. This is not a gap that closes—it compounds.

Russia ranks 31st globally in AI capability (Tortoise Index), behind not just the US and China but also BRICS partners India and Brazil. The Federal AI Programme allocates R$1.145 trillion ($11.5B) for 2025, but money cannot purchase capability when technology supply chains are severed.

**The stagflation scenario** is increasingly likely: inflation remains high (currently elevated) while growth stalls. Russia's central bank has already recorded sequential GDP declines in Q1-Q2 2025—meeting the definition of technical recession.

**Why conventional "resilience" narratives miss the point**:
- War production is not economic development
- GDP that measures shell production is not GDP that measures prosperity
- Technology isolation compounds; each year widens the gap
- Brain drain accelerates as educated Russians emigrate
- Energy infrastructure requires Western technology for maintenance

**Near term (2026-2028)**: War economy continues. Official statistics show modest growth driven by military production. Civilian economy stagnates. Inflation remains elevated. Technology gap widens.

**Mid term (2029-2032)**: Accumulated damage becomes undeniable. Infrastructure degradation accelerates without Western technology for maintenance. Brain drain reaches critical mass. AI capabilities fall further behind.

**Late term (2033-2036)**: Two scenarios: (1) Conflict resolution enables partial reintegration—significant capability loss is permanent but decline stabilizes; (2) Continued isolation—Russia becomes technological backwater, dependent on China for advanced systems.

**Classification rationale**: "Declining" rather than "Collapsing" because Russia maintains state coherence and sufficient resources (energy, agriculture, minerals) to avoid Venezuela-style catastrophe. But the trajectory is unambiguously negative, and technology isolation ensures no return to pre-2022 trajectory.
