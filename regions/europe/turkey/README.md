## December 2025 Reality

Turkey is stabilizing but not yet stable:

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **GDP growth 2025** | 3.1-3.5% |
| **Inflation (late 2025)** | 31% (down from 86% in late 2022) |
| **2025 inflation projection** | 29-35% (IMF: 34.9%) |
| **2026 inflation projection** | 18-20% |
| **Global GDP rank** | 16th largest (7th in Europe) |
| **Manufacturing share** | 22% of GDP |

**Policy shift**: Orthodox monetary policy since mid-2023 has succeeded in reducing inflation from 86% to 31%—but disinflation is incomplete.

Turkey presents a genuinely contested case—neither clearly winning nor declining, with outcomes heavily dependent on whether inflation stabilization proves durable and whether structural reforms materialize. The economy is large (16th globally), has manufacturing depth, and bridges Europe and Asia geographically. Yet chronic inflation, weak FDI, and political uncertainty create genuine uncertainty about trajectory.

The inflation story dominates. After peaking at 86% in late 2022, Turkey's adoption of orthodox monetary policy (interest rate hikes, fiscal discipline) has reduced inflation to 31%. Projections suggest 18% by end-2026 and 15% by end-2027. This is remarkable progress—but inflation remains far above developed economy levels, and any policy reversal could reignite the spiral.

Manufacturing provides structural strength that financial services-dependent economies lack. At 22% of GDP, manufacturing—led by automotive, textiles, and steel—provides export capacity and productive employment. Turkey produced 1.35 million motor vehicles in 2022 (13th globally). This industrial base offers AI-era adaptation potential if investment materializes.

## Middle Eastern Sphere Expansion

The Assad regime's collapse in late 2024 has created opportunities for Turkish influence expansion—not into Europe (where NATO/EU barriers remain formidable) but into the Middle East, where power vacuums now exist.

**Northern Syria**: Turkey now exercises de facto control or strong influence over significant portions of northern Syria. This provides:
- Buffer zone against Kurdish autonomy (Turkey's primary security concern)
- Agricultural resources (the Euphrates basin)
- Reconstruction contracts and economic integration
- Population management leverage (Syrian refugee return)

**Northern Iraq**: Turkish military presence in northern Iraq has expanded, ostensibly targeting PKK but establishing longer-term positioning:
- Energy resources (Kirkuk oil fields proximity)
- Trade route control
- Kurdish Regional Government relationships

**Regional positioning**: Turkey is positioning itself as the dominant Sunni power in the northern Middle East:
- Competitor to Iran (weakened post-Assad collapse)
- Alternative to Saudi/UAE influence
- Bridge between Europe and the Gulf states
- Potential arbiter in post-conflict Syria

**Constraints on expansion**:
- Israeli interests in southern Syria create potential friction
- Russian presence (diminished but not eliminated) complicates operations
- Iranian proxy networks remain active
- Economic costs of occupation/reconstruction strain Turkey's inflation-fighting efforts
- NATO membership creates tensions with adventurist policies

**Assessment**: Turkey's expansion is more plausibly Middle Eastern than European. Claims that Turkey threatens Greece or Bulgaria militarily overstate Turkish capacity and understate NATO Article 5 deterrence. However, Turkish consolidation of influence in Syria and Iraq is actively underway and could provide the resource base and strategic depth that the domestic economy currently lacks.

**Critical uncertainties**:
- **Inflation durability**: Will orthodox policy persist, or will political pressure force premature easing?
- **FDI recovery**: Weak foreign investment limits capital for modernization
- **Political trajectory**: Erdogan's long tenure creates succession uncertainty
- **Geopolitical positioning**: Turkey's NATO membership + Russia/Iran relationships create complexity
- **Middle Eastern consolidation**: Can Turkey convert military presence into durable economic/political influence?

**Bull case**: Inflation reaches single digits by 2027. FDI returns. Manufacturing modernization proceeds. Turkey leverages geographic position as Europe-Asia bridge. GDP growth sustains 3-4% annually.

**Bear case**: Inflation proves sticky above 20%. Political pressure forces monetary easing. FDI remains weak. Structural reforms stall. Growth falls to 1-2% as competitiveness erodes.

**Near term (2026-2028)**: Disinflation continues but slowly. Manufacturing maintains growth. New FDI strategy targets high-value sectors. Outcome depends on policy consistency.

**Mid term (2029-2032)**: Decisive period. Either: inflation reaches developed-economy levels and investment accelerates; or chronic moderate inflation (10-20%) persists, eroding competitiveness.

**Late term (2033-2036)**: Trajectory clarifies. Turkey either emerges as regional manufacturing power with diversified economy, or remains trapped in middle-income status with periodic instability.

**Classification rationale**: "Contested" because both positive and negative scenarios are plausible, and the determining factors (policy consistency, political trajectory) cannot be confidently forecast.
