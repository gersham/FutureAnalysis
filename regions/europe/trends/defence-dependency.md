# European Defence Dependency

## The Three-Week Assumption

Throughout the Cold War and its aftermath, European defence planning operated on a foundational assumption: NATO forces needed to hold for approximately three weeks until American reinforcements arrived in sufficient strength. This was not a failure of planning but a deliberate strategic choice—European nations outsourced strategic depth to the United States in exchange for welfare state expansion.

This assumption shaped:

- **Force structure**: Designed for delay and defence, not sustained independent operations
- **Logistics**: Limited ammunition stocks, fuel reserves, and supply chain independence
- **Industrial base**: Defence manufacturing contracted as "peace dividend" was harvested
- **Training doctrine**: Interoperability with US forces prioritised over European autonomy

The assumption was rational when American commitment was unquestioned. It becomes catastrophic when that commitment wavers.

## December 2025 Checkpoint: US NSS

The December 2025 US National Security Strategy introduced explicit spheres-of-influence language that, if implemented, would transform European security assumptions. See [US Strategic Reorientation](../../../global/trends/us-strategic-reorientation.md) for details.

**Key signals from the published NSS:**
- US will "reject the ill-fated concept of global domination" in favour of "global and regional balances of power"
- Section on "Promoting European Greatness" frames Europe's problems as "civilizational" rather than merely strategic
- Proposes rewarding nations that "take more responsibility for security in their neighborhoods"

**Unverified reporting** (Defense One, December 9): A longer classified version proposes a "Core 5" (C5) forum of US, China, Russia, India, Japan—explicitly excluding Europe from top-tier global governance.

**Assessment**: This represents a potential shift from "wavering commitment" (reversible) to "strategic reorientation" (structural). If confirmed, the timeline for European adjustment compresses significantly. Track for confirming/disconfirming signals in Q1-Q2 2026.

## The Command Problem

European military integration faces a structural barrier that economic integration does not: no European nation will accept another European nation's command.

**Historical precedent**: NATO functioned because Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) was always American. This external arbiter resolved the status competition that would otherwise paralyse multinational operations.

**Current reality**:
- France will not accept German command
- Germany will not accept French command
- Neither will accept British command (post-Brexit, outside EU structures)
- Smaller nations will not accept command from larger neighbours with historical grievances
- Italy, Spain, Poland each have reasons to resist subordination to Franco-German leadership

**The EU's attempts at defence coordination**:
- Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP): Limited to small peacekeeping missions
- Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO): 60+ projects, minimal operational capability
- European Defence Fund: €8 billion 2021-2027—approximately one month of US defence spending
- No unified command structure, no integrated logistics, no common procurement at scale

## Capability Gaps

European NATO members collectively spend approximately €300 billion annually on defence. The output in deployable capability is far less than this figure suggests:

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| **Ammunition stocks** | Many nations have days-to-weeks of wartime consumption |
| **Air defence** | Dependent on US systems; European alternatives years away |
| **Strategic airlift** | Minimal independent capacity |
| **Intelligence/surveillance** | Heavy reliance on US satellites and signals intelligence |
| **Precision munitions** | Stocks depleted by Ukraine transfers; production scaling slowly |
| **Naval power projection** | France alone has a carrier; limited amphibious capability |

The Ukraine war exposed these gaps. European nations transferred equipment they could not quickly replace. Production lines that had been wound down take years to restart.

## The Coordination Trap

Europe faces a collective action problem:

1. **No single nation** can provide credible defence alone
2. **Coordination requires** accepting subordination or external command
3. **External command (US)** is precisely what is becoming unreliable
4. **Internal command** triggers status competition and historical grievances
5. **Result**: Rhetorical commitment to European defence, operational paralysis

This is not a problem that can be solved by spending increases alone. Even with adequate budgets, the command and coordination problem remains.

## Implications

**Near term (2026-2028)**:
- Continued reliance on US despite rhetorical shifts
- Bilateral arrangements (UK-France, Nordic cooperation) rather than EU-wide integration
- Ammunition and equipment procurement accelerates but capability gaps persist

**Mid term (2029-2032)**:
- If US disengagement continues, ad hoc coalitions form around specific threats
- Franco-German tensions over leadership intensify
- Eastern European nations (Poland, Baltics) may prioritise bilateral US relationships over EU defence

**Late term (2033-2036)**:
- Either: A crisis forces genuine integration under emergency conditions
- Or: European defence fragments into regional groupings (Nordic, Eastern, Mediterranean)
- Full European strategic autonomy remains unrealised absent external forcing function

The structural dependency is not merely a matter of spending or political will. It is embedded in institutional design, historical memory, and the absence of any legitimate arbiter for intra-European command disputes.
