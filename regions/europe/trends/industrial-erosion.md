# Industrial Erosion

*The structural uncompetitiveness of European heavy industry.*

## The "Triple Whammy"

European industry faces a convergence of three structural negative shocks that are not cyclical and will not "pass":

1.  **Permanent Energy Disadvantage:**
    *   Since the loss of cheap Russian pipeline gas (2022), Europe relies on global LNG markets.
    *   LNG is structurally more expensive than piped gas or US domestic shale gas (liquefaction + transport + regasification costs).
    *   Result: European industrial energy costs are structurally 2-3x higher than US/Chinese competitors.

2.  **Decarbonization Costs:**
    *   The EU ETS (Emissions Trading System) imposes real costs on carbon.
    *   CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism) attempts to protect industry, but downstream users pay higher prices for materials, making finished goods uncompetitive globally.

3.  **Chinese Overcapacity:**
    *   China's deflationary growth model is exporting massive overcapacity in EVs, steel, chemicals, and machinery.
    *   State-subsidized Chinese goods undercut European producers who are already struggling with high energy costs.

## Sectoral Impact

*   **Chemicals (BASF, etc.):** Moving production to the US (Gulf Coast) or China to chase cheap energy/feedstock.
*   **Automotive (VW, BMW):** Losing market share in China (their biggest profit pool) and facing low-cost EV competition at home.
*   **Steel/Aluminum:** Smelting is electricity-intensive; production is shutting down or moving to jurisdictions with stranded hydro/coal assets.

## The Deindustrialization Spiral

As heavy industry leaves, the "Mittelstand" (specialized SME supply chain) loses its local customers. The industrial cluster effects that made Germany a powerhouse begin to unwind. Innovation slows as the feedback loop between factory floor and engineering office is broken.

## Falsifiable Criteria
- **Industrial Output:** German industrial production index remains below 2019 levels for the entire 2025-2028 period.
- **FDI Outflows:** Net Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from the EU to the US in manufacturing sectors remains positive (outflow) for 3 consecutive years.
- **Plant Closures:** Major shutdowns of primary production facilities (steel furnaces, chemical crackers) in Germany/France exceed 5 sites per year.
