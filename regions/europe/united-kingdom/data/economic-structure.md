# United Kingdom Economic Structure

*Sectoral composition and vulnerabilities.*

## Financial Services Dependence

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Financial + professional services | 15-20% of GDP |
| Tax revenue share | Even higher |
| City of London employment | ~500K |

## What the UK Lacks

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Manufacturing base | Largely absent |
| Technology companies | None capturing AI gains |
| Energy resources | No cheap domestic supply |
| Data centre capacity | ~1 GW (inadequate) |

## Maximum Vulnerability

The UK combines:
- Services economy (most exposed to AI)
- Financial services (exposed to AI + alternative finance)
- No manufacturing fallback
- No technology sector capturing gains
- No energy resources for infrastructure

This is maximum exposure to AI transition disruption with no offsetting advantages.
