# United Kingdom Economic Structure

*Sectoral composition and vulnerabilities.*

## Financial Services Dependence

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Financial + professional services | 15-20% of GDP |
| Tax revenue share | Even higher |
| City of London employment | ~500K |

## What the UK Lacks

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Manufacturing base | Largely absent |
| Technology companies | None capturing AI gains |
| Energy resources | No cheap domestic supply |
| Industrial electricity | **$0.22-0.32/kWh** (highest in Europe; 2.5-4x US) |
| Data centre capacity | ~1 GW (inadequate) |

## Energy Cost Disadvantage

The UK has the **highest industrial electricity prices in Europe**:

| Country | USD/kWh | vs EU14 Median |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| UK | $0.22-0.32 (17-26p/kWh) | **+89%** |
| Ireland | $0.27 | +44% |
| Germany | $0.20-0.22 | +6% |
| France | $0.17 | -10% |
| EU14 Median | ~$0.19 | — |
| US | $0.08 | -58% |
| China | $0.09 | -53% |

At 2.5-4x US electricity costs, the UK cannot compete on compute-intensive activity. Energy-intensive UK industries have contracted **33% since 2021**—the lowest level since records began in 1990. Very large industrial users pay 22p/kWh, more than 5x what Finnish industrial users pay (4p/kWh).

## Maximum Vulnerability

The UK combines:
- Services economy (most exposed to AI)
- Financial services (exposed to AI + alternative finance)
- No manufacturing fallback
- No technology sector capturing gains
- No energy resources for infrastructure

This is maximum exposure to AI transition disruption with no offsetting advantages.
