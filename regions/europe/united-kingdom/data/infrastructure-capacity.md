# United Kingdom Infrastructure Capacity

*Data centre and energy infrastructure as of 2025.*

## Data Centre Capacity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current (2025) | ~1.0 GW |
| Projected (2030) | 2-3 GW |
| Assessment | **Inadequate** |

## Constraints

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Energy resources | No cheap domestic energy |
| Expansion land | London lacks space |
| Power costs | Cannot compete with US on data centre economics |
| Grid capacity | Limited expansion potential |

## Comparison

| Country | 2025 GW | 2030 GW |
|---------|---------|---------|
| United States | 53.7 | 81+ |
| United Kingdom | ~1.0 | 2-3 |
| **Gap** | **54x** | **27-40x** |

The infrastructure gap will widen, not close.
