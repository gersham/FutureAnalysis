## Scenario Structure

This is a **fully worked example** showing how the [methodology](../../../METHODOLOGY.md) maps to a specific country. The UK is chosen because it illustrates the framework under stress conditions.

### Scenario Table

| Scenario | Probability | Outcome | Description |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Upside** | Low (around one-in-five) | Managed decline | Institutional resilience; sterling devaluation restores competitiveness; successful niche pivots |
| **Central** | More likely than not | Material contraction | Financial services compress significantly; episodic unrest but not systemic; muddling through |
| **Downside** | Non-trivial minority risk | Severe contraction + instability | Financial services collapse; sustained unrest; emergency governance; capital flight and emigration |

### What Would Move Us Between Scenarios

| Signal | Direction | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Sterling crisis with controlled devaluation (30%+) | Upside ↑ | Restores export competitiveness; reduces real wages without political conflict |
| Major regulatory liberalisation (2027-2028) | Upside ↑ | UK-specific AI deployment advantage vs EU |
| Financial services job losses exceed 100k/year | Downside ↓ | Faster than fiscal adjustment; unemployment surge |
| Serious civil unrest (3+ cities, sustained) | Downside ↓ | Investment flight; talent emigration; institutional strain |
| Scotland independence vote passes | Downside ↓ | Fiscal shock; institutional uncertainty; precedent effects |
| EU regulatory loosening | Central stabilises | Reduces UK's relative regulatory advantage |

## Applying the Displacement Model

### Step 1: Sector Exposure

The UK economy is unusually weighted toward high-displacement sectors:

| Sector | UK Share of Employment | Expected Displacement/Year | Exposure |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------------|----------|
| Financial services | ~3.5% (1.1M direct) | 6-10% | **High** |
| Professional services | ~5% | 5-8% | **High** |
| Administrative/clerical | ~10% | 5-8% | **High** |
| Retail | ~9% | 2-4% | Moderate |
| Healthcare (NHS) | ~5% | 1-3% | Low |
| Manufacturing | ~8% | 3-5% | Moderate |

Relative to the 5% scenario baseline, the UK's service‑heavy economy faces higher‑than‑baseline displacement pressure.

### Step 2: Factor Analysis

Using the [archetype framework](../../../METHODOLOGY.md), the UK is a "mid-sized developed" economy:

| Factor | UK Position | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Compute access | Below average | Limited domestic capacity; reliant on US‑hosted compute |
| Energy cost | Weak | Electricity 3–4x US levels; constrains data centre build‑out |
| Regulatory environment | Mixed | Post‑Brexit divergence creates friction without clear AI advantage |
| Capital markets | Strong | Deep financial markets; can fund adaptation if incentives align |
| Talent base | Moderate | Solid technical and professional base; brain drain risk if outlook worsens |
| Cultural adoption | Mixed | Frontier firms adopt quickly; broader economy and public opinion more hesitant |

**Interpretation**: The UK sits in a structurally challenging position on the key factors that determine AI‑era positioning. Strong capital markets and a decent talent base partially offset weak energy and compute position, but not enough to change the central-case outlook in this scenario.

### Step 3: Binding Constraints

For the UK specifically:
1. **Energy cost** (electricity 3-4x US levels): Cannot compete on data centre build-out
2. **Regulatory uncertainty**: Post-Brexit regulatory divergence creates friction without clear AI advantage
3. **Financial services concentration**: Single point of failure; 15-20% of GDP, higher share of tax revenue
4. **No domestic AI champions**: Dependent on US/Chinese technology

### Step 4: Deriving Outcome (Qualitative)

Using the sector exposure and factor bundle:
- High exposure to finance/professional/admin functions (above scenario baseline)
- Adverse energy/compute position; regulatory uncertainty; strong capital markets
- Limited domestic AI champions

→ Expected outcome under the 5%/year displacement scenario: **material contraction** (central), with **credible tails** to managed decline (upside) or severe contraction with instability (downside).

## Current Reality (December 2025)

The UK's economic indicators show surface stability masking structural vulnerability:

- **GDP Q3 2025**: +0.1% (down from +0.3% Q2)
- **Services growth**: +0.2% (but declining trajectory)
- **Production sector**: -0.5% (manufacturing contracting)
- **Data centre capacity**: ~1 GW (less than 2% of US levels)

**Financial services disruption is accelerating:**
- 27,000 banking jobs at risk (Juniper/Zopa Bank research)
- 178 million work hours potentially eliminated over 5 years
- First confirmed AI-orchestrated cyberattack on UK infrastructure (November 2025)

**Why conventional forecasts may be wrong**: The OBR and major banks project UK GDP growth of 1.0-1.5% through 2030. These projections assume no major financial services disruption, continued City of London tax revenue, and successful "muddling through" as Britain has historically managed. This analysis weights those assumptions as less likely than the displacement model suggests.

## The Central Case Narrative

The United Kingdom represents a high-stress test case for AI-era adaptation. Multiple vulnerabilities compound:

**Economic structure**: A [services economy](data/economic-structure.md) unusually exposed to cognitive automation; financial services contributing 15-20% of GDP; approximately [one gigawatt of data centre capacity](data/infrastructure-capacity.md) with no energy resources to expand competitively; no manufacturing base; no technology companies capturing AI gains.

**The [services compression](trends/services-collapse.md)** at the heart of the British economy is structural, not cyclical. Every core financial function—credit decisions, trading strategies, compliance monitoring, fraud detection, customer service, back-office operations—is amenable to AI automation. The UK will not lead this transition; it will be disrupted by it.

**Legitimacy and social cohesion**: The UK has been [haemorrhaging legitimacy](trends/legitimacy-fracture.md) for a generation. Academic researchers studying civil conflict have identified structural preconditions for serious unrest: polarisation, loss of institutional legitimacy, identity-based factionalism. The [demographic fractures](trends/demographic-fractures.md)—unassimilated populations, housing crisis, generational wealth gaps—compound economic stress.

**In the central case**: Financial services contract substantially by 2035; employment in exposed sectors falls faster than new opportunities emerge; living standards decline; episodic unrest occurs but institutions hold; Scotland remains (narrowly); the UK becomes poorer but does not fragment.

## Adaptation Pathways (What Could Go Right)

The central case is not destiny. Specific adaptation channels could move the UK toward the upside scenario:

### 1. Sterling Devaluation as Adjustment Mechanism

A managed or market-forced 30%+ sterling devaluation would:
- Reduce real wages without political conflict over nominal cuts
- Restore export competitiveness
- Make UK assets attractive to foreign buyers
- Reduce the real burden of domestic-currency obligations

Historical precedent: 1992 ERM exit, post-2016 Brexit depreciation. The UK has used currency adjustment before.

### 2. Radical Regulatory Liberalisation

A "Singapore-on-Thames" pivot could include:
- AI deployment exemptions from EU-style regulation
- Financial services deregulation to attract AI-native finance
- Immigration policy shift toward high-skill technical workers
- Tax incentives for AI infrastructure investment

Probability: Low under current political configuration; higher if economic stress forces policy rethink.

### 3. Unexpected Institutional Resilience

British institutions have historically demonstrated surprising resilience:
- The civil service may adapt better than expected
- Social cohesion may prove stronger than demographics suggest
- The City may successfully pivot to new AI-era financial services

This is the "muddling through" scenario that has historically worked for Britain. The question is whether this time is different.

## Timeline

### Near Term (2026-2028)

- Financial services employment begins visible decline (5-8% annually)
- Data centre projects stall on energy constraints
- Sterling under pressure; possible 15-20% depreciation
- First major AI-driven redundancy announcements
- Political debate on AI regulation intensifies

### Mid Term (2029-2032)

**Central case**:
- Financial services employment materially lower
- Public finances under pressure; public service cuts likely
- One or more episodes of serious civil unrest
- Emigration of high‑skill workers accelerates

**Upside case**:
- Regulatory liberalisation attracts some AI investment
- Sterling stabilisation after devaluation
- Adjustment remains manageable

**Downside case**:
- Financial services contraction becomes severe
- Sustained unrest in multiple cities
- Scotland independence referendum passes
- Emergency governance measures

### Late Term (2033-2036)

Outcomes diverge significantly based on which path materialises. The central case sees a poorer, diminished UK that has not fragmented but has permanently lower living standards. The upside sees a leaner, adapted economy. The downside sees ongoing instability with unclear resolution.

## Implications

### For Individuals in the UK

- **Career planning**: Assume structural decline in professional services; skills portable to other jurisdictions have option value
- **Asset allocation**: Geographic diversification prudent; sterling-denominated assets carry currency risk
- **Citizenship**: Alternative citizenship/residency has significant option value
- **Timing**: Waiting for confirmation of fracture may mean waiting too long; early movers have more options

### For Businesses

- **UK exposure**: Re-evaluate UK revenue/cost concentration
- **Talent**: Expect competition for remaining high-skill workers
- **Regulatory arbitrage**: Monitor for opportunities if UK liberalises

### For Investors

- **UK equities**: Multinationals with global revenue may outperform domestically-focused firms
- **Sterling**: Structural depreciation pressure; may be opportunity after overshoot
- **UK property**: Prime London may hold value; regional property faces demographic and economic headwinds
