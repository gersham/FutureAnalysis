# Demographic Fractures

*Population dynamics that compound economic stress.*

## Immigration and Integration

The UK has experienced sustained immigration that has produced:
- Large unassimilated populations
- Geographic concentration in specific areas
- Visible cultural and economic stratification

## Housing Crisis

The housing crisis creates additional fracture lines:
- Prevents family formation
- Creates generational wealth gap
- Concentrates resentment
- Makes geographic mobility difficult

## Why This Matters for AI Transition

Demographic fractures compound AI displacement:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Unassimilated populations | Create identity-based factionalism |
| Housing crisis | Prevents adjustment via mobility |
| Generational divide | Young face displacement with no assets |
| Geographic concentration | Problems concentrate in specific areas |

## Comparison: Why UK Fractures While Japan Stagnates

| Factor | UK | Japan |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Demographic homogeneity | Low | High |
| Unassimilated populations | Significant | Minimal |
| Identity-based conflict potential | High | Low |
| Internal fracture lines | Multiple | Few |

Japan can experience economic decline without social fracture because its population is homogeneous. The UK cannot.
