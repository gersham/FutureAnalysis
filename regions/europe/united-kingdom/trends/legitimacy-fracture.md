# Legitimacy Fracture

*Pre-existing institutional failures compounding economic disruption.*

## The Legitimacy Deficit

The UK has been haemorrhaging institutional legitimacy for years:

| Institution | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Government | Trust at historic lows |
| Media | Credibility collapsed |
| Political establishment | Doubling down on failing policies |
| Justice system | Two-tier system visible to all |

## Structural Preconditions

Academic researchers studying civil conflict have identified the UK as displaying structural preconditions for serious unrest:

- Extreme polarisation
- Loss of institutional legitimacy
- Identity-based factionalism
- Perception that system operates against significant population segments

## Why Economic Shock Triggers Political Crisis

Economic disruption alone does not produce instability. Japan has endured decades of stagnation without civil unrest.

What transforms economic stress into political crisis is **collapsed legitimacy**. When populations no longer accept that institutions have the right to govern, economic pressure becomes political pressure.

The UK has:
- Pre-existing legitimacy deficit
- Incoming economic shock (services collapse)
- No institutional credibility to absorb it

## The Troubles Parallel

The UK has historical precedent for sustained low-level political violence. The Troubles demonstrated that:
- British state can lose effective sovereignty over territory
- Low-level violence can persist for decades
- Infrastructure can become political target

Something like the Troubles, but wider in geographic scope and less structured in organisation, becomes probable.
