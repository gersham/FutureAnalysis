# Energy Diversification

*Poland's pragmatic approach to energy security.*

## Historical Dependence

Poland historically relied heavily on:
- Coal (domestic, abundant, carbon-intensive)
- Russian gas (geopolitically vulnerable)

## Diversification Underway

Post-2022, Poland has aggressively diversified:

| Initiative | Status |
|------------|--------|
| LNG import terminal (Swinoujscie) | Operational, expanded |
| Baltic Pipe (Norwegian gas) | Operational |
| Nuclear programme | In development |
| Offshore wind | In development |

## Contrast with Germany

| Factor | Poland | Germany |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Nuclear stance | Building | Closing |
| Energy transition ideology | Pragmatic | Committed |
| Russian dependence response | Cut decisively | Reluctantly adjusted |
| Coal usage | Continuing | Phasing out ideologically |

## Energy Cost Trajectory

Poland's energy costs remain:
- Higher than US (structural)
- Competitive with Western Europe
- Improving relative to Germany

## Implications for AI Infrastructure

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Data centre expansion | Possible |
| Energy costs | Moderate |
| Grid capacity | Developing |
| Competitive position | Improving vs Western Europe |

Poland may become an alternative to Germany/France for European data centre investment.
