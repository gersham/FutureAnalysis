# Ideological Independence

*Poland avoided the ideological capture that paralysed Western governance.*

## The Western Governance Trap

Western European governments became captured by ideological commitments that:
- Prioritise symbolic goods over material outcomes
- Block necessary economic adjustments
- Prevent honest assessment of policy failures
- Create blind spots around immigration, energy, and regulation

## Poland's Different Path

Poland's governance maintained focus on:

| Priority | Western Europe | Poland |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Economic growth | Secondary | Primary |
| Energy security | Ideology-constrained | Pragmatic |
| Immigration policy | Ideological | Restrictive |
| EU relationship | Full integration | Selective |

## Why This Matters

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Energy transition | Not pursuing German-style Energiewende |
| Immigration | Avoided integration problems |
| Regulation | Less captured by precautionary principle |
| Industrial policy | Can support manufacturing |

## The Contrast

Germany cannot address manufacturing decline because ideological commitment to energy transition prevents corrective action.

France cannot restructure because ideological commitments prevent honest assessment of banlieue dynamics.

UK cannot control immigration because ideological commitments prevent enforcement.

Poland retains policy flexibility because it never adopted these constraints.
