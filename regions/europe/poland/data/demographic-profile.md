# Poland Demographic Profile

*Younger and more homogeneous than Western neighbours.*

## Age Structure

| Metric | Poland | Germany | UK |
|--------|--------|---------|-----|
| Median age | ~41 | ~44 | ~40 |
| Youth unemployment | Lower | Moderate | Higher |
| Dependency ratio | Lower | Higher | Moderate |

Poland's demographic profile is younger than Germany's, providing a somewhat larger working-age population during the transition period.

## Cultural Homogeneity

| Factor | Poland | Western Europe |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Ethnic homogeneity | High | Lower |
| Religious homogeneity | High | Lower |
| Immigration-driven change | Limited | Significant |
| Integration challenges | Minimal | Substantial |

Poland avoided large-scale immigration from outside Europe:
- No equivalent to German/French immigration patterns
- No banlieue-style zones
- No parallel societies
- Social cohesion higher

## Implications

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Economic stress | Less likely to compound into ethnic conflict |
| Social cohesion | Maintained during transition |
| Political stability | Higher than France/UK |
| Integration costs | Not a significant factor |
