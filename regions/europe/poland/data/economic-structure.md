# Poland Economic Structure

*Lower exposure to AI-vulnerable sectors.*

## Sectoral Composition

| Sector | Share of GDP | AI Vulnerability |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| Manufacturing | ~20% | Moderate (robotics wave) |
| Services | ~65% | Lower than Western Europe |
| Agriculture | ~3% | Low |

## Key Differentiator

Poland differs from Western European economies in critical ways:

| Factor | Poland | Western Europe |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Financial services share | Lower | Higher |
| Professional services | Smaller | Larger |
| Manufacturing base | Growing | Declining |
| Services exposure | Moderate | High |

## Manufacturing Resilience

Poland has built a growing manufacturing base:
- Automotive (significant and expanding)
- Electronics
- Industrial components
- Food processing

This manufacturing orientation provides partial insulation from the first wave of AI automation that targets cognitive/administrative work.

## Second Wave Exposure

The robotics wave (post-2030) will affect manufacturing, but:
- Later timing allows preparation
- Manufacturing more likely to remain onshore (logistics, energy)
- Poland's cost structure remains competitive
