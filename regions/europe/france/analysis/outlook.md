# France Outlook: 2026-2036

> **Classification**: Fracturing
> **GDP Projection**: -2 to -4% annually
> **Confidence**: Moderate-High

## Core Assessment

France combines economic decline with serious civil unrest risk. The classification as "Fracturing" rather than "Declining" reflects the probability of social breakdown, not merely economic contraction.

## Why Fracturing Rather Than Declining

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Nuclear energy | Genuine advantage—unrealised |
| Public sector exposure | ~25% of workforce at risk |
| Political capacity | Paralysed |
| Social cohesion | Fractured |
| Banlieue dynamics | Ungovernable trajectory |
| Youth unemployment | Catastrophic trajectory |
| Historical pattern | Yellow Vest precedent |

Germany declines but maintains social cohesion. France faces the combination of economic decline *and* social fragmentation.

## Predictions by Period

### Near Term (2026-2028)

| Prediction | Criterion | Confidence |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Yellow Vest-type movement returns | Sustained protests >3 months | High |
| Youth unemployment rises | Exceeds 25% nationally | High |
| Public sector strikes | Paralysing action >1 month | Moderate |
| Le Pen-type political rise | RN or successor >30% polling | Moderate |

### Mid Term (2029-2032)

| Prediction | Criterion | Confidence |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Political realignment | Le Pen-type figure takes power | Moderate |
| Banlieues become ungovernable | State withdraws from certain zones | Moderate |
| Infrastructure attacks | Coordinated disruption of utilities | Moderate |
| Fiscal crisis | Sovereign debt concerns emerge | Moderate |

### Late Term (2033-2036)

| Prediction | Criterion | Confidence |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Effective territorial fragmentation | Zones of limited state sovereignty | Moderate |
| Sustained low-level violence | Not civil war but chronic unrest | Moderate |
| Economic baseline reset | GDP 15-20% below 2025 | Moderate |

## What Political Change Cannot Fix

The incoming government—whoever it is—will inherit:
- Economy in structural decline
- Massive public sector that cannot be restructured
- Banlieues beyond integration
- Fiscal position deteriorating
- Nuclear advantage unutilised

Political realignment changes who governs amid chaos, not the chaos itself.
