# Social Fracture

*The combustible combination of economic stress and demographic division.*

## Banlieue Dynamics

The suburban peripheries of French cities represent zones of limited state authority:

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Integration | Failed or absent |
| Youth unemployment | Catastrophic levels |
| State presence | Diminished |
| Parallel economies | Established |

## Youth Unemployment Crisis

AI automation compounds an already severe youth unemployment problem:

| Projection | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Current youth unemployment | Already elevated |
| With AI displacement | Becomes catastrophic |
| Political effect | Radicalisation across spectrum |
| Geographic concentration | Banlieues and provincial cities |

## Yellow Vest Dynamics

The Yellow Vest movement demonstrated:
- Spontaneous mobilisation outside traditional structures
- Infrastructure disruption as political tool
- Geographic spread beyond Paris
- Security forces stretched thin

Future episodes likely to be:
- More intense (higher economic stakes)
- More prolonged (less to lose)
- More geographically distributed
- More destructive

## Toward Ungovernable Zones

The trajectory points toward effective loss of state sovereignty over portions of national territory:

| Stage | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| Current | State presence weak in some zones |
| Mid-term | Banlieues become functionally autonomous |
| Late term | Effective state sovereignty limited |

This is not civil war in the formal sense but sustained low-level violence and territorial fragmentation.
