# Political Paralysis

*France's inability to deploy its advantages coherently.*

## The Core Problem

France possesses genuine strategic advantages—particularly nuclear energy—but the political system cannot translate these into coherent action:

| Factor | Manifestation |
|--------|---------------|
| Institutional gridlock | Competing power centres block decisions |
| Ideological fragmentation | No governing consensus possible |
| Street politics | Yellow Vest-style movements disrupt policy |
| Elite disconnection | Governing class detached from population |

## Historical Pattern

France has experienced repeated episodes of political instability when economic stress meets social fragmentation. The Yellow Vest movement demonstrated that:

- Economic grievances can mobilise sustained protest
- Traditional political parties cannot channel discontent
- Security forces face legitimacy challenges
- Infrastructure becomes a political target

## Why Reform Fails

| Barrier | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Public sector | Unions block workforce restructuring |
| Banlieues | Integration policy absent or failing |
| Elites | Macron-style technocracy discredited |
| Opposition | Le Pen-type alternative waits but cannot heal |

## Trajectory

The political class cannot address structural decline because:
- No coalition can form around necessary reforms
- Reforms would require confronting protected constituencies
- Street opposition to any significant change
- Incoming government (whoever it is) inherits fiscal ruin
