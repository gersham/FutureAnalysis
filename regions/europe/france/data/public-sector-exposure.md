# France Public Sector Exposure

*The scale of automation-vulnerable employment.*

## Public Sector Employment

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Public sector share of workforce | ~25% |
| Total public employees | ~5.7 million |
| Assessment | **Maximum exposure** |

France has one of the largest public sectors in the developed world, employing approximately one quarter of the workforce.

## Automation Vulnerability

The public sector is heavily weighted toward administrative functions amenable to AI automation:

| Function | Automation Risk |
|----------|-----------------|
| Administrative processing | High |
| Social services coordination | High |
| Documentation and records | High |
| Compliance and regulation | High |
| Service delivery coordination | Moderate |

## Why This Matters

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Fiscal pressure | Tax revenue declining while public wage bill persists |
| Political resistance | Public sector unions politically powerful |
| Structural rigidity | Civil service protections prevent workforce adjustment |
| Social compact | Public employment is implicit social contract |

The combination of massive public sector exposure and political inability to restructure creates fiscal crisis conditions.
