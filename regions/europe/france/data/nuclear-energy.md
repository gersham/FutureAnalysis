# France Nuclear Energy

*France's unique energy position in Europe.*

## Nuclear Capacity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Electricity from nuclear | ~70% |
| Operating reactors | 56 |
| Relative energy cost (vs Germany) | Significantly lower |

France possesses the largest nuclear fleet in Europe and generates approximately 70% of its electricity from nuclear power—a genuine strategic advantage in the AI era.

## Potential for AI Infrastructure

Unlike Germany and the UK, France *could* power significant AI infrastructure:

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Energy availability | Adequate |
| Energy cost | Competitive |
| Technical capacity | Exists |

## Why the Advantage Goes Unrealised

The political system cannot deploy this advantage coherently:

- State apparatus paralysed by competing interests
- Investment decisions delayed by institutional gridlock
- Social unrest disrupts infrastructure development
- Ideological divisions prevent strategic focus

France has the technical capability but lacks the political capacity to translate energy advantage into AI economic power.
