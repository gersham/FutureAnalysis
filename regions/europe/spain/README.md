## December 2025 Reality

Spain leads eurozone growth:

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **GDP growth 2025** | 2.9% (fastest major economy globally in 2024) |
| **2026 projected** | 2.3% |
| **2027 projected** | 2.0% |
| **Debt-to-GDP** | Below 100% for first time since 2019 |
| **Driver** | Domestic demand, strong labor market, investment |

**Context**: Spain was the world's fastest-growing major economy in 2024. Macro-financial vulnerabilities have been reduced.

Spain represents the eurozone's success story—but a modest one. Growth of 2.9% dramatically outperforms Germany (-0.1%), France (+0.7%), or Italy (+0.4%). Debt-to-GDP falling below 100% for the first time since 2019 signals fiscal improvement. Strong labor markets support consumption. Spain is doing what Europe needs to do—but whether this translates to AI-era competitiveness remains uncertain.

The services-oriented model that drives current success is also Spain's constraint. Tourism booms, but tourism is not AI productivity gains. Strong net migration provides labor force growth that Germany and Italy lack, but low-value-added jobs dominate. The concern is that Spain outperforms peers while still falling behind global competitors.

**Growth drivers**:
- Services economy with tourism as core pillar
- Strong net migration providing demographic support
- Reduced macro-financial vulnerabilities from post-2008 restructuring
- Domestic demand supported by labor market strength

**Growth constraints**:
- Prevalence of low-value-added jobs keeps productivity low
- Protracted weak investment limits capital accumulation
- Digital transformation slower than leaders
- Limited convergence toward eurozone per capita income levels projected

**Comparison with Portugal**: Both Iberian economies outperform Northern Europe, sharing services orientation, tourism strength, and demographic advantages. Portugal leads slightly in growth (Q3 2025: +0.8% vs Spain's quarterly performance), but Spain's scale provides resilience.

**Near term (2026-2028)**: Growth moderates from 2.9% toward 2.0% but remains eurozone-leading. Tourism continues strong. Investment gradually improves.

**Mid term (2029-2032)**: Critical test of whether growth translates to productivity gains or represents structural ceiling. AI adoption pace determines whether Spain remains "Survivor" or advances to "Winner."

**Late term (2033-2036)**: Outcome visibility. Either: Spain demonstrates services-led growth can generate prosperity without manufacturing dominance; or productivity constraints manifest as relative decline despite positive absolute growth.

**Classification rationale**: "Survivor" because Spain grows and improves, but structural factors (productivity, value-added) suggest limited AI-era advantage. Spain survives well but doesn't transform.
