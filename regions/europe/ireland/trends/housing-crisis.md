# Housing Crisis

*Ireland's most severe domestic challenge.*

## Current Status

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Housing availability | Acute shortage |
| Price trajectory | Continued increases |
| Rental market | Severe constraints |
| Building rate | Below required |

## Why It Matters

The housing crisis:
- Constrains labour market flexibility
- Concentrates economic stress on younger workers
- Creates political grievances
- Limits population mobility

## Comparison with UK

| Factor | Ireland | UK |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Severity | Severe | Severe |
| Scale | Smaller population | Larger population |
| Political salience | High | High |
| Resolution capacity | Possibly higher | Lower |

Both countries face acute housing shortages. Ireland's smaller scale may make resolution more tractable.

## Economic Effect

The housing crisis interacts with AI displacement:
- Workers cannot relocate for opportunities
- Young workers face dual pressure (housing costs + job displacement)
- Concentrated grievances in Dublin area

## Policy Response Capacity

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Government awareness | High |
| Resource availability | Strong fiscal position |
| Implementation capacity | Moderate |
| Timeline to resolution | Uncertain |

Ireland has fiscal resources to address housing—whether political will matches resources remains to be seen.
