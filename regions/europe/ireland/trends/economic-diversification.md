# Economic Diversification

*Ireland's economy is more diverse than commonly recognised.*

## Beyond Big Tech

The pessimistic thesis focuses on:
- Tech headquarters attracted by tax arbitrage
- Financial services back-office operations
- Both highly automatable

But Ireland's actual economic structure includes:

| Sector | Presence | AI Vulnerability |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| Pharmaceuticals | Major manufacturing | Lower |
| Medical devices | Major manufacturing | Lower |
| Technology | HQ and operations | Higher |
| Financial services | Operations | Higher |
| Food/agri | Significant | Lower |

## Modified Domestic Demand

Irish GDP figures are distorted by multinational accounting. Modified domestic demand—a better measure of the actual Irish economy—shows:
- Continued growth
- Less volatile than GDP
- More representative of domestic conditions

## Employment Resilience

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| FDI employment | Record levels |
| Unemployment | ~4.5% |
| During tech slowdown | Minimal impact |

The 2022-2024 tech sector slowdown affected headlines but not aggregate employment significantly.

## Small Nation Advantage

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Population | ~5 million |
| Pivot speed | Faster than large nations |
| Historical precedent | Multiple reinventions since 1980s |
| Adaptability | Demonstrated |

Ireland has reinvented itself repeatedly—from agricultural backwater to Celtic Tiger to tech hub. Small nations can pivot faster than large ones.
