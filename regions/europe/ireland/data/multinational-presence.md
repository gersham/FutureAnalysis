# Ireland Multinational Presence

*The depth and breadth of foreign direct investment.*

## Scale of FDI

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Number of multinationals | 1,800+ |
| FDI employment | 300,000+ |
| Sectors | Tech, pharma, medtech, financial services |

Ireland hosts the European headquarters and operations centres of major American technology companies, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and financial services firms.

## Sectoral Distribution

| Sector | Employment | Vulnerability |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| Technology | High | Moderate-High |
| Pharmaceuticals | Moderate | Lower |
| Medical devices | Moderate | Lower |
| Financial services | Moderate | High |

## The Tax Arbitrage Foundation

Ireland's multinational presence rests on:
- Corporate tax rate (12.5%)
- Tax treaties and structures
- English-speaking workforce
- EU market access
- Time zone position

## Diversification Argument

The pessimistic thesis focuses on tech headquarters vulnerability. The counter:
- More than 1,800 firms, not just big tech
- Pharma and medtech less vulnerable to automation
- Manufacturing operations (not just headquarters)
- FDI employment remained at record levels even during tech slowdown

## Grid Constraint

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Dublin data centre capacity | At grid limit |
| New connections | Moratorium in effect |
| Expansion capacity | Limited without grid investment |

The grid constraint is real but affects expansion, not existing operations.
