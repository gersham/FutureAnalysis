# Ireland Stability Record

*Quarter-century without significant political violence.*

## Post-Good Friday Agreement

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Years since major violence | 25+ (since 1998) |
| Good Friday Agreement | 1998 |
| Assessment | Sustained stability |

Ireland has been remarkably stable since the Good Friday Agreement—over a quarter century without significant political violence.

## Why This Matters

Historical memory of the Troubles exists but:
- Institutional settlement has held
- Cross-community cooperation established
- Economic prosperity reduced grievances
- New generations lack direct experience

## Contrast with UK

| Factor | Ireland | UK |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Recent political violence | Absent | Present (riots 2024) |
| Institutional trust | Higher | Lower |
| Social cohesion | Higher | Lower |
| Integration policy | Less contested | More contested |

## Risk Factors

The pessimistic thesis argues economic stress could rekindle sectarian or class-based conflict. However:
- Northern Ireland settlement separate from Republic
- Republic lacks UK's demographic fractures
- Smaller, more cohesive population
- Strong institutional framework

## Bottom Line

Ireland's stability record is genuine, not assumed. This differentiates it from the UK case where recent instability is observable.
