| **France** | 4 PMs in 2025 | +0.7% | Fracturing |
| **Poland** | $1T economy | +3.7% | Winner |
| **UK** | Services contracting | +0.1% | Fracturing |
| **Switzerland** | Banking collapse | ~+1% | Declining |
| **Spain** | Eurozone leader | +2.9% | Survivor |

Europe has chosen the precautionary principle elevated to continental strategy, and will pay for that choice with civilisational decline. Two structural dynamics compound the economic challenges: a [defence dependency](trends/defence-dependency.md) on the United States that cannot be quickly unwound, and a [welfare-defence tradeoff](trends/welfare-defence-tradeoff.md) that creates a fiscal trap with no politically viable exit. The EU AI Act, the most comprehensive AI regulation globally, imposes costs on AI deployment that American and Chinese competitors do not bear. The regulation will not stop AI—it will ensure that AI is deployed against European firms by competitors who face no such constraints. The human-in-the-loop becomes the human holding the bag. Simultaneously, an energy crisis makes AI infrastructure expansion fundamentally uncompetitive: German electricity costs three to four times US levels, and the entire European Union possesses 11.9 gigawatts of data centre capacity—less than a quarter of American levels—with projections to reach only 41 GW by 2030 (versus US 132 GW).

Within this continental decline, outcomes diverge sharply. Two nations face fracturing: the [United Kingdom](united-kingdom/README.md) and [France](france/README.md). Two face managed decline: [Germany](germany/README.md) and [Switzerland](switzerland/README.md). One emerges as a surprising winner: [Poland](poland/README.md). And one—[Ireland](ireland/README.md)—presents a contested case where confident prediction is not warranted.

The [United Kingdom](united-kingdom/README.md) represents the central case for Western fracture. Every vulnerability compounds: a services economy devastated by automation; financial services disrupted by AI and alternative finance; approximately one gigawatt of data centre capacity but no energy resources to expand competitively; no manufacturing base; no technology companies capturing AI gains; a housing crisis preventing family formation; immigration policy producing large unassimilated populations; a two-tier justice system visible to all; and a political establishment doubling down on failing policies. The structural preconditions for serious civil unrest are present. Something like the Troubles, but wider in geographic scope and less structured in organisation, becomes probable. The United Kingdom is classified as "Fracturing" with projected GDP contraction of three to six percent annually.

[France](france/README.md) combines economic decline with serious civil unrest risk. The paradox is that France possesses what Germany and the UK lack—nuclear energy that could power AI infrastructure—but the political system cannot deploy that advantage coherently. The public sector employs a quarter of the workforce and faces massive automation pressure. Youth unemployment becomes catastrophic. The banlieues become ungovernable. The Yellow Vest movement returns with greater intensity. A Le Pen-type figure eventually takes power but inherits fiscal ruin and social chaos. France does not experience civil war in the formal sense but sustained low-level violence and effective loss of state sovereignty over portions of national territory. France is classified as "Fracturing" with projected GDP contraction of two to four percent annually.

[Germany](germany/README.md) faces genuine structural collapse but will decline rather than fracture. The manufacturing base is haemorrhaging from energy costs and Chinese competition; software culture is absent; the political class remains paralysed by ideological commitments to energy transition regardless of industrial consequence. Frankfurt's data centre hub cannot expand competitively when electricity costs three to four times American levels. Yet Germany differs from the UK and France in ways that make decline more likely than fracture: social cohesion remains higher, institutional capacity stronger, demographic composition more stable. Political realignment is coming—the AfD or a successor movement will eventually govern—but whoever takes power inherits an economy in structural decline with no obvious path to recovery. Germany is classified as "Declining" with projected GDP contraction of two to four percent annually.

[Switzerland](switzerland/README.md) faces a particular challenge: its economy is heavily weighted toward financial services, private banking, and high-end professional services—precisely the sectors most vulnerable to AI automation and alternative finance disruption. The private banking model is dying: secrecy advantages have eroded, relationship managers are being replaced by AI, and wealth is moving toward crypto custody and decentralised alternatives. Pharmaceutical and precision manufacturing provide buffer but cannot compensate for the structural decline of Switzerland's financial core. Switzerland is classified as "Declining" with projected GDP contraction of one to two percent annually.

[Poland](poland/README.md) is the most surprising positive case in Europe. Less exposed to service-sector automation than Western neighbours, possessed of a growing manufacturing base, demographically younger and more culturally homogeneous, Poland avoided the ideological capture that has paralysed Western European governance. Energy diversification is underway; the American security umbrella remains intact. Poland's advantage is essentially what it lacks: no financial services bubble to pop, no public sector larger than it can afford, no energy costs in permanent crisis, no ideological paralysis, no demographic fragmentation. Poland is classified as "Winner" with projected GDP growth of three to four percent annually.

[Ireland](ireland/README.md) presents a contested case with high variance in possible outcomes. The pessimistic thesis focuses on tech headquarters attracted by tax arbitrage and financial services back-office operations—both highly automatable. Dublin's data centre grid is at capacity; the housing crisis is severe. The optimistic counter-thesis notes over a quarter century of stability since 1998, economic diversification across more than 1,800 multinational firms including pharma and medtech less exposed to AI automation, and small-nation adaptability. Ireland is classified as "Contested" with projected GDP ranging from negative one percent to positive two percent annually—a genuinely uncertain case where the honest analytical position is to acknowledge uncertainty.

The European Union itself faces uncertain survival. The combination of economic divergence between member states, migration pressures, political polarisation, and Brexit precedent creates non-trivial risk of further fragmentation. By 2035, the EU may exist in diminished form or with reduced membership. The regulations that were meant to protect European citizens will have ensured their impoverishment relative to jurisdictions that embraced rather than restrained AI deployment.

The [defence dependency](trends/defence-dependency.md) that served Europe well during the Cold War becomes a critical vulnerability as American commitment wavers. European forces were designed to hold for three weeks until American reinforcement—not to operate independently. More fundamentally, no European nation will accept another European nation's command, and no framework exists for unified European military operations without American leadership. The [welfare-defence tradeoff](trends/welfare-defence-tradeoff.md) compounds this: rearmament requires either welfare cuts (politically impossible) or debt accumulation (fiscally constrained). The likely outcome is rhetorical commitment to defence with inadequate actual capability, leaving Europe dependent on an American umbrella that is fraying.

On Europe's periphery, [Turkey](turkey/README.md) pursues expansion—but the direction is Middle Eastern rather than European. Turkish consolidation of influence in post-Assad Syria and northern Iraq is actively underway and may provide resource and strategic depth. Claims of Turkish military threats to Greece or Bulgaria overstate Turkish capacity and understate NATO Article 5 deterrence; Turkish adventurism is constrained by NATO membership even as it exploits opportunities in the post-Assad vacuum.
