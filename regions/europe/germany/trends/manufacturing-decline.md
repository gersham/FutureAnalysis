# Manufacturing Decline

*The structural erosion of Germany's industrial base.*

## Current Status

The manufacturing base is already haemorrhaging from:
- Energy costs (3-4x US levels)
- Chinese competition
- EV transition disruption (automotive)

## Why Structural Rather Than Cyclical

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Energy costs | No path to competitive costs |
| Chinese competition | Intensifying, not reversing |
| Software culture | Absent; Germany never developed significant tech sector |
| Investment flows | Capital moving to lower-cost jurisdictions |

## Automotive Vulnerability

German automotive is particularly exposed:
- EV transition disrupting traditional advantage
- Chinese EVs more competitive
- Battery supply chain not German-controlled
- Software-defined vehicles require capabilities Germany lacks

## Partial Offset: Robotics

Germany is adopting humanoid robotics in manufacturing, suggesting some adaptation capacity. But this cannot compensate for broader structural decline—it is a defensive measure, not a growth driver.

## Timeline

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 2026-2028 | Contraction accelerates; -10% manufacturing employment |
| 2029-2032 | Restructuring; remaining capacity concentrates in automated operations |
| 2033-2036 | New smaller equilibrium; Germany no longer industrial powerhouse |
