# Political Realignment

*The coming transformation of German politics.*

## Current Paralysis

The political class remains paralysed by ideological commitments to energy transition regardless of industrial consequence. The traditional centre-left/centre-right governing consensus cannot address structural economic decline.

## AfD Rise

Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) continues electoral gains:
- Expected to exceed 25% in federal polling
- Trajectory toward government participation (federal or major state)
- Represents political realignment rather than temporary protest

## Eventual Outcome

A Le Pen-type political realignment is likely:
- AfD or a successor movement will eventually govern
- Or will force fundamental coalition shifts
- Traditional parties either transform or diminish

## What Political Change Cannot Fix

The incoming government—whoever it is—will inherit:
- Economy in structural decline
- Energy costs that cannot be quickly reversed
- Manufacturing base that has already left
- No obvious path to recovery

Political realignment changes who manages decline, not the fact of decline.

## Timeline

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 2026-2028 | AfD consolidates; exceeds 25% |
| 2029-2032 | Government participation or coalition-forcing |
