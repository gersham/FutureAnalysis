# Germany Outlook: 2026-2036

> **Classification**: Declining
> **GDP Projection**: -2 to -4% annually
> **Confidence**: High

## Core Assessment

Germany faces genuine structural collapse. This is high confidence because multiple structural factors align and no plausible reversal path exists.

## Why Declining Rather Than Fracturing

Germany differs from UK/France in ways that make decline more likely than fracture:

| Factor | Germany | UK/France |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Social cohesion | Higher | Lower |
| Institutional capacity | Stronger | Weaker |
| Manufacturing base | Exists (declining) | Absent (UK) |
| Demographic composition | More stable | More fractured |
| Political culture | Consensus-oriented | More polarised |

Decline is structural and severe, but managed decline remains more probable than fracture.

## Predictions by Period

### Near Term (2026-2028)

| Prediction | Criterion | Confidence |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Manufacturing contraction accelerates | Employment -10% from 2025 | High |
| AfD growth | Exceeds 25% federal polling | Moderate |
| Data centre stagnation | Capacity growth <0.3 GW | High |

### Mid Term (2029-2032)

| Prediction | Criterion | Confidence |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Political realignment | AfD in federal or major state government | Moderate |
| Brain drain | Net emigration of university-educated >100K/year | Moderate |
| Industrial restructuring | Remaining manufacturing highly automated | Moderate |

### Late Term (2033-2036)

| Prediction | Criterion | Confidence |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Structural decline entrenched | GDP per capita below France | Moderate |
| Political transformation | Post-war consensus parties diminished | Moderate |
| EU role reduced | Germany's anchor capacity diminished | Moderate |
