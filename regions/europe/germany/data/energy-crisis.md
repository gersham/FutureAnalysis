# Germany Energy Crisis

*Structural energy cost disadvantage.*

## Electricity Cost Comparison

| Region | Relative Cost |
|--------|---------------|
| United States | 1x (baseline) |
| Germany | 3-4x |

## Data Centre Implications

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Capacity (2025) | ~0.8 GW |
| Projected (2030) | 1.5-2 GW |
| Assessment | **Energy Crisis** |

Frankfurt hub is hamstrung by energy costs. Cannot expand competitively.

## Root Causes

- Nuclear phase-out (strategic error now difficult to reverse)
- Russian gas dependence (disrupted)
- Energiewende costs
- Grid infrastructure challenges

## No Near-Term Solution

Energy cost disadvantage is structural, not cyclical. No politically plausible path to competitive energy costs in forecast period.
