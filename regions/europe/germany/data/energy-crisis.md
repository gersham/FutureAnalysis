# Germany Energy Crisis

*Structural energy cost disadvantage.*

## Industrial Electricity Prices (2025)

| Consumer Type | Germany | US | Multiple |
|---------------|---------|-----|----------|
| Medium industry (standard) | €0.18-0.20/kWh ($0.20-0.22) | $0.08 | 2.5-2.75x |
| Large industry (with exemptions) | €0.12/kWh ($0.13) | $0.08 | 1.6x |
| Commercial (50 MWh/year) | €0.305/kWh ($0.33) | — | — |

Germany's medium industrial electricity price of **$0.20-0.22/kWh** is slightly above the EU average (~$0.19) and 2.5-2.75x US levels. Large energy-intensive industries receive exemptions (Strompreisbremse) bringing their costs to ~€0.12/kWh—but these exemptions strain public finances and don't extend to medium industry or data centres.

**Note**: Germany is **not** the most expensive in Europe—the UK (89% above EU median) and Ireland (€0.27/kWh) are worse. But Germany's costs remain structurally uncompetitive vs. US and China for energy-intensive activities.

## Data Centre Implications

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Capacity (2025) | ~0.8 GW |
| Projected (2030) | 1.5-2 GW |
| Assessment | **Energy Crisis** |

Frankfurt hub is hamstrung by energy costs. Cannot expand competitively.

## Root Causes

- Nuclear phase-out (strategic error now difficult to reverse)
- Russian gas dependence (disrupted)
- Energiewende costs
- Grid infrastructure challenges

## No Near-Term Solution

Energy cost disadvantage is structural, not cyclical. No politically plausible path to competitive energy costs in forecast period.
