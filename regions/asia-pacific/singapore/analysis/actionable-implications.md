|--------|---------|
| Financial services | Significant pressure; adaptation required |
| Technology | Limited scale but quality opportunities |

|--------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Governance quality | Excellent | Declining | Variable |
| Growth opportunity | Moderate | Low | High |
| Stability | Very high | Low | Moderate |

| Tech career | Quality opportunities exist; scale limited |
| Regional role | Positions connected to ASEAN coordination |

### Strategic Considerations

- Singapore for talent—quality over quantity

## For Investors

### Singapore Exposure

| Asset Class | Assessment |
|-------------|------------|
| REITs | Financial sector headwinds |
| Banks | Structural pressure |
| Property | High quality but limited growth |
| Government bonds | Extremely safe |

### Positioning

|--------|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Outlook | Survivor | Declining | Fracturing |
| Financial exposure | High | High | High |
