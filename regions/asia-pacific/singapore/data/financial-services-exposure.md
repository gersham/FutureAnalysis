# Singapore Financial Services Exposure

*The scale of vulnerability.*

## Sectoral Weight

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Financial services share of GDP | ~14% |
| Related services (legal, professional) | Significant |
| Total exposure | ~20%+ with related services |

Financial services represent approximately fourteen percent of Singapore's GDP—a substantial exposure to AI automation and alternative finance disruption.

## Functions at Risk

| Function | AI Vulnerability |
|----------|------------------|
| Wealth management | High |
| Trade finance | High |
| Back-office operations | High |
| Compliance | High |
| Customer service | High |
| Trading | Already automated |

## The Hub Model Vulnerability

Singapore's value proposition as Asia's neutral financial hub faces structural challenge:

| Historical Value | Current Status |
|------------------|----------------|
| Neutral jurisdiction | Less differentiating |
| Well-governed | Less differentiating |
| Human intermediation | AI replaces |
| Regional coordination | AI reduces need |

## Scale Comparison

| Hub | Financial Services % GDP |
|-----|--------------------------|
| Singapore | ~14% |
| UK | ~15-20% |
| Switzerland | ~10% |

Singapore's exposure is comparable to UK and Switzerland.
