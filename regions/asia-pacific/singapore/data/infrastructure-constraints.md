# Singapore Infrastructure Constraints

*The physical limits on expansion.*

## Data Centre Status

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current capacity | ~1 GW |
| Vacancy rate | <2% |
| Expansion capacity | Limited |
| Assessment | Constrained |

## Binding Constraints

### Land Scarcity

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Total land area | ~730 sq km |
| Available for expansion | Very limited |
| Competition for land | Intense |

Singapore is one of the smallest countries by land area; every square meter is contested.

### Power Limitations

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Generation capacity | Limited |
| Import dependence | High |
| Expansion potential | Constrained |

Power infrastructure cannot easily expand to support major data centre growth.

### Competitive Position

| Hub | Data Centre Capacity | Land | Power |
|-----|----------------------|------|-------|
| Virginia | 12+ GW | Abundant | Abundant |
| Singapore | ~1 GW | Scarce | Limited |
| Frankfurt | ~0.8 GW | Moderate | Expensive |

Singapore cannot compete on AI infrastructure scale.

## Implications

Singapore must compete on:
- Governance quality
- Regional coordination
- Niche services
- Cannot compete on compute scale
