# Demographic Divergence

*The widening gap between the aging North and the youthful South.*

## The Great Divide

Asia-Pacific is not demographically uniform. It contains the world's fastest-aging societies and some of its largest youthful populations. This divergence drives capital flows, labor migration pressures, and differing automation imperatives.

### The Aged (Crisis Mode)
*   **Japan:** Median age ~49. Population declining by >800k/year.
*   **China:** Median age ~39 (rapidly rising). Working-age population peaked in 2014 and is shrinking by millions annually.
*   **South Korea:** Fertility rate <0.7 (lowest in world). Existential demographic threat.

**Implication:** These nations *must* automate. Robotics and AI are not choices but survival mechanisms to maintain economic output with a shrinking workforce.

### The Youthful (Dividend Mode?)
*   **India:** Median age ~28. Working-age population continues growing until ~2050.
*   **Indonesia:** Median age ~30. Large "demographic bonus" window open until ~2040.
*   **Philippines:** Median age ~25. Major exporter of labor (BPO).

**Implication:** These nations face a "premature automation" trap. They need to create millions of jobs for new market entrants just as AI begins to automate the entry-level manufacturing and services roles that traditionally absorbed such labor.

## Data Snapshot (Projections to 2035)

| Country | 2025 Population | 2035 Projection | Trend | Old-Age Dependency Ratio (2035) |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|---------------------------------|
| **China** | 1.41B | ~1.39B | Decline | High (30% >60y) |
| **Japan** | 123M | ~116M | Rapid Decline | Very High (33% >65y) |
| **India** | 1.45B | ~1.55B | Growth | Low (Rising) |
| **Indonesia** | 280M | ~295M | Growth | Moderate |

## Analytical Conclusion
Capital will flow from the Aged North (seeking labor/growth) to the Youthful South (seeking capital). However, AI disrupts this classic development model. If the North can automate production at home, they may stop investing in Southern manufacturing, stranding the Youthful nations with vast unemployed populations and no "ladder" to development.

## Falsifiable Criteria
- **Labor Flow:** Formal migration programs from India/SE Asia to Japan/Korea increase quotas by >50% by 2028.
- **Reshoring:** Chinese FDI in Southeast Asia manufacturing slows or reverses by 2030 as domestic automation becomes cheaper than offshoring.
