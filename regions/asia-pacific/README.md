## December 2025 Reality

Asia-Pacific leads globally in AI adoption and manufacturing growth:

| Country | GDP Growth 2025 | AI Adoption | Outlook |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Vietnam** | **8.23%** (Q3) | High FDI | Winner |
| **India** | **6.5-6.9%** | **92% enterprise** | Winner |
| **Indonesia** | 5.1-5.4% | **92% workplace** | Winner |
| **China** | 4-5% | 93% employees | Winner |
| **Malaysia** | 4.0-4.5% | Semiconductors | Winner |
| **Australia** | 3-4% | Growing | Winner (Contingent) |
| **Singapore** | 2-3% | DBS: 800 AI models | Survivor |
| **Japan** | 1.0% | 51-56% | Survivor |
| **South Korea** | 0.8-1.0% | 5th globally | Survivor |
| **Thailand** | 2.0-2.4% | Digital strong | Contested |

**Key finding**: India and Indonesia both show **92% enterprise/workplace AI adoption**—the world's highest. Chinese workers are **3x more likely** to embrace AI than Americans (54% vs 17%, Edelman 2025).

Asia-Pacific demonstrates what cultural disposition toward technology adoption can achieve. Survey data consistently shows Asian societies adopting AI faster and more enthusiastically than Western counterparts. KPMG's 2025 global study found 93% of Chinese employees use AI at work—versus 58% globally. Chinese citizens are approximately **2-3x as optimistic** about AI's benefits as Americans (83% vs 39%). This cultural reservoir of technological optimism—built through successive waves of manufacturing automation, mobile payments, high-speed rail, and electric vehicles that delivered visible benefits—translates into economic outcomes. While Europe debates regulations and imposes costs its competitors do not bear, Asia deploys AI broadly. The results vary by country—China's state-directed model differs fundamentally from Japan's managed stagnation differs from Australia's resource play—but the regional trajectory is generally more favourable than Europe's.

[China](china/README.md) pursues aggressive AI adoption regardless of social cost, backed by state capacity to suppress dissent and direct economic restructuring. With **31.9 gigawatts** of data centre capacity—second only to the United States—China possesses the computational infrastructure to remain competitive. However, **up to 80% of recently added capacity sits idle**, suggesting execution challenges beneath the headline numbers. The government announced a **$138 billion AI/quantum fund** in March 2025. The cultural disposition toward technology adoption combines with state-directed investment to produce rapid deployment across sectors. Demographic decline poses genuine headwinds: China faces the most severe demographic contraction of any major economy, and the race between AI productivity gains and workforce shrinkage will determine growth trajectory. The Party may view aggressive automation as essential to maintain economic output despite shrinking workforce—BYD's target of **20,000 humanoid robots by 2026** exemplifies this strategy. The critical risk is Taiwan: any military conflict would completely disrupt China's trajectory through sanctions, supply chain destruction, and potential military losses. The probability is low but non-trivial; the impact if it occurs is catastrophic. China is classified as "Winner" with projected GDP growth of four to six percent annually, contingent on Taiwan status quo continuing.

[Japan](japan/README.md) will manage decline with characteristic dignity. Already the most automated major economy—roughly 400 industrial robots per 10,000 manufacturing workers—Japan is culturally prepared for technological integration in manufacturing but paradoxically conservative about AI in services and governance. Survey data shows only 46 percent AI optimism and 51 percent organisational adoption—the lowest in Asia-Pacific. Risk aversion, consensus requirements, and employment practices that resist worker displacement slow adoption. Demographic decline caps dynamism, but the absence of significant unassimilated populations means AI-driven unemployment will not compound into political crisis. Japan demonstrates that managed decline is a viable trajectory: not catastrophic, not dynamic, but stable. Social cohesion, strong institutions, and cultural acceptance of reduced dynamism provide cushion. Japan is classified as "Survivor" with projected GDP growth of one to two percent annually.

[Singapore](singapore/README.md) will adapt because Singapore always adapts—but the landing zone is smaller than it once appeared. Financial services contribute approximately 14 percent of GDP and face the full force of AI automation and alternative finance disruption. The city-state's historical value proposition as Asia's neutral financial hub relied on human intermediation; AI-enabled decentralisation reduces the value of that intermediation. Infrastructure constraints bind: approximately one gigawatt of data centre capacity with vacancy below two percent, and land scarcity and power limitations prevent significant expansion. Singapore cannot compete on AI infrastructure scale; it must compete on governance quality and niche services. The technocratic elite understands existential threat and will attempt a pivot toward AI governance services, regional coordination, and new niches. Whether viable niches exist at sufficient scale is the central uncertainty. Singapore is classified as "Survivor" with projected GDP growth of two to four percent annually.

[Australia](australia/README.md) is unexpectedly advantaged by geography and geology. Critical minerals for AI hardware—lithium, rare earths, copper, nickel, cobalt—exist in significant deposits in a politically stable jurisdiction. Uranium reserves are among the world's largest as nuclear power demand grows. Natural gas provides export revenue and domestic energy security. Solar potential is exceptional across vast land areas. Data centre capacity of **1.3-2.2 gigawatts** is expanding rapidly toward **3.1-4.1 gigawatts by 2030**, with major investments from Amazon (AUD $20B) and Microsoft (AUD $5B). A **supply gap of 0.7-1.7 GW** is expected by 2028, indicating demand outpacing infrastructure. The services economy in Sydney and Melbourne will suffer AI displacement, but resource exports will more than compensate if regulatory choices permit. The risk is that Australia follows the European regulatory model on AI governance, forfeiting advantages geography provides. Australia is classified as "Winner (Contingent)" with projected GDP growth of three to five percent annually, contingent on regulatory choices.

[India](india/README.md) is positioned as a major winner of the AI transition—not by creating the foundational models, but by adopting them aggressively at scale while providing the services and talent that global AI deployment requires. Survey data places India at 92% enterprise AI adoption—the highest measured globally. The combination of demographic dividend (working-age population growing through 2035+, median age ~28), cultural enthusiasm for technology, and deep integration with global technology ecosystems through 1,700 Global Capability Centers creates a structural position unlike any other major economy. India can absorb AI productivity gains while still having labour force growth—capturing benefits that nations with shrinking workforces cannot fully realise. NITI Aayog projects AI adoption could contribute $500-600 billion to India's GDP by 2035, potentially enabling 8% growth and an $8.3 trillion economy. The constraints are infrastructure (power, logistics), inequality (gains concentrating among educated urban populations), and regulatory uncertainty. India is classified as "Winner" with projected GDP growth of six to eight percent annually.

The regional picture reveals divergent paths within shared cultural advantages. China, India, and Australia are winners—one through state-directed deployment, one through demographic dividend and services integration, one through resource endowment. Japan and Singapore are survivors—one through managed decline with demographic stability, one through technocratic adaptation within binding constraints. All benefit from cultural dispositions toward technology adoption that exceed Western levels. None faces the fracturing risk that threatens the United Kingdom and France. The Asia-Pacific trajectory is not uniformly positive—Japan stagnates, Singapore faces structural challenge—but it is uniformly more favourable than what awaits much of Europe.
