## December 2025 Reality

Asia-Pacific leads globally in AI adoption and manufacturing growth:

| Country | GDP Growth 2025 | Key Factor | Outlook |
|---------|-----------------|------------|---------|
| **Vietnam** | **8.23%** (Q3) | Transshipment-inflated; tariff risk | Contested |
| **India** | **6.5-6.9%** | IT services vulnerable | Contested |
| **Indonesia** | 5.1-5.4% | Infrastructure gaps | Survivor |
| **China** | 4-5% | State-directed AI | Winner |
| **Malaysia** | 4.0-4.5% | Semiconductors | Contested |
| **Australia** | 3-4% | Resources/regulatory risk | Winner (Contingent) |
| **Singapore** | 2-3% | Financial services exposed | Survivor |
| **Japan** | 1.0% | Managed decline | Survivor |
| **South Korea** | 0.8-1.0% | Demographics | Survivor |
| **Thailand** | 2.0-2.4% | Structural challenges | Contested |

**Key dynamic**: China's state capacity enables aggressive AI deployment; India's IT services face automation; Indonesia's infrastructure limits AI capture despite scale.

## The ASEAN Dynamo (Not Fortress China)

There is no "Fortress China" equivalent to Fortress America. China has systematically alienated its neighbors through South China Sea aggression, border disputes with India, and coercive economic practices. In October 2025 alone, Chinese ships rammed Philippine vessels at Thitu Island and continued water cannon harassment of fishing boats operating in Manila's EEZ. ASEAN remains divided; the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia increasingly align with US security architecture while Cambodia and Laos remain in China's orbit.

What exists instead is an **ASEAN Dynamo**—a regional economic engine that benefits from *both* supply chain diversification away from China *and* continued Chinese investment seeking tariff avoidance:

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **ASEAN GDP growth** | 4.3% (2025) | AMRO |
| **ASEAN collective GDP** | $4+ trillion (4th largest economy) | WEF |
| **FDI inflows 2024** | $235 billion (record) | UNCTAD |
| **Chinese manufacturing FDI** | $10B/year avg (vs $2.7B pre-2020) | Rhodium |
| **Digital economy GMV** | $300 billion (2025) | Google/Temasek |
| **Data center capacity growth** | +180% planned | e-Conomy SEA |

**The dynamic**: ASEAN benefits whether the US or China "wins" the trade war:
- US tariffs on China → supply chains diversify to Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia
- Chinese firms seek tariff avoidance → manufacturing FDI flows to ASEAN
- Both sides invest in ASEAN infrastructure → $200B+ in new commitments from Japan, Australia, India, South Korea
- Regional integration deepens → ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement signed 2025

**The limits**: Intra-ASEAN trade remains only ~22% of total (vs 60%+ in EU). Much of the "ASEAN manufacturing" is actually Chinese firms relocating for tariff arbitrage—the same transshipment dynamic affecting Vietnam. ASEAN unity fractures on China policy. Infrastructure gaps (Indonesia, Philippines) limit absorption capacity.

**The thesis**: ASEAN is not a fortress but a conduit—benefiting from being the neutral ground where great power competition plays out through investment rather than conflict. The region captures spillover from both American AI dominance and Chinese manufacturing relocation. This is not as powerful as Fortress America (ASEAN doesn't border the AI goliath), but it provides regional tailwinds that partially offset country-specific weaknesses.

Asia-Pacific demonstrates what cultural disposition toward technology adoption can achieve. Survey data consistently shows Asian societies adopting AI faster and more enthusiastically than Western counterparts. KPMG's 2025 global study found 93% of Chinese employees use AI at work—versus 58% globally. Chinese citizens are approximately **2-3x as optimistic** about AI's benefits as Americans (83% vs 39%). This cultural reservoir of technological optimism—built through successive waves of manufacturing automation, mobile payments, high-speed rail, and electric vehicles that delivered visible benefits—translates into economic outcomes. While Europe debates regulations and imposes costs its competitors do not bear, Asia deploys AI broadly. The results vary by country—China's state-directed model differs fundamentally from Japan's managed stagnation differs from Australia's resource play—but the regional trajectory is generally more favourable than Europe's.

[China](china/README.md) pursues aggressive AI adoption regardless of social cost, backed by state capacity to suppress dissent and direct economic restructuring. With **31.9 gigawatts** of data centre capacity—second only to the United States—China possesses the computational infrastructure to remain competitive. However, **up to 80% of recently added capacity sits idle**, suggesting execution challenges beneath the headline numbers. The government announced a **$138 billion AI/quantum fund** in March 2025. The cultural disposition toward technology adoption combines with state-directed investment to produce rapid deployment across sectors. Demographic decline poses genuine headwinds: China faces the most severe demographic contraction of any major economy, and the race between AI productivity gains and workforce shrinkage will determine growth trajectory. The Party may view aggressive automation as essential to maintain economic output despite shrinking workforce—BYD's target of **20,000 humanoid robots by 2026** exemplifies this strategy. The critical risk is Taiwan: any military conflict would completely disrupt China's trajectory through sanctions, supply chain destruction, and potential military losses. The probability is low but non-trivial; the impact if it occurs is catastrophic. China is classified as "Winner" with projected GDP growth of four to six percent annually, contingent on Taiwan status quo continuing.

[Japan](japan/README.md) will manage decline with characteristic dignity. Already the most automated major economy—roughly 400 industrial robots per 10,000 manufacturing workers—Japan is culturally prepared for technological integration in manufacturing but paradoxically conservative about AI in services and governance. Survey data shows only 46 percent AI optimism and 51 percent organisational adoption—the lowest in Asia-Pacific. Risk aversion, consensus requirements, and employment practices that resist worker displacement slow adoption. Demographic decline caps dynamism, but the absence of significant unassimilated populations means AI-driven unemployment will not compound into political crisis. Japan demonstrates that managed decline is a viable trajectory: not catastrophic, not dynamic, but stable. Social cohesion, strong institutions, and cultural acceptance of reduced dynamism provide cushion. Japan is classified as "Survivor" with projected GDP growth of one to two percent annually.

[Singapore](singapore/README.md) will adapt because Singapore always adapts—but the landing zone is smaller than it once appeared. Financial services contribute approximately 14 percent of GDP and face the full force of AI automation and alternative finance disruption. The city-state's historical value proposition as Asia's neutral financial hub relied on human intermediation; AI-enabled decentralisation reduces the value of that intermediation. Infrastructure constraints bind: approximately one gigawatt of data centre capacity with vacancy below two percent, and land scarcity and power limitations prevent significant expansion. Singapore cannot compete on AI infrastructure scale; it must compete on governance quality and niche services. The technocratic elite understands existential threat and will attempt a pivot toward AI governance services, regional coordination, and new niches. Whether viable niches exist at sufficient scale is the central uncertainty. Singapore is classified as "Survivor" with projected GDP growth of two to four percent annually.

[Australia](australia/README.md) is unexpectedly advantaged by geography and geology. Critical minerals for AI hardware—lithium, rare earths, copper, nickel, cobalt—exist in significant deposits in a politically stable jurisdiction. Uranium reserves are among the world's largest as nuclear power demand grows. Natural gas provides export revenue and domestic energy security. Solar potential is exceptional across vast land areas. Data centre capacity of **1.3-2.2 gigawatts** is expanding rapidly toward **3.1-4.1 gigawatts by 2030**, with major investments from Amazon (AUD $20B) and Microsoft (AUD $5B). A **supply gap of 0.7-1.7 GW** is expected by 2028, indicating demand outpacing infrastructure. The services economy in Sydney and Melbourne will suffer AI displacement, but resource exports will more than compensate if regulatory choices permit. The risk is that Australia follows the European regulatory model on AI governance, forfeiting advantages geography provides. Australia is classified as "Winner (Contingent)" with projected GDP growth of three to five percent annually, contingent on regulatory choices.

[India](india/README.md) presents a contested case that inverts conventional wisdom about demographics and AI. India's economic success story rests on IT services outsourcing—call centers, BPO, software maintenance, technical support—employing ~5 million directly and ~15 million indirectly. Every one of these functions is amenable to AI automation. The cruel irony: India's high AI adoption metrics (92% enterprise adoption) may reflect companies *using* AI to automate the very Indian workforce they previously employed. Western firms enthusiastic about AI are enthusiastic precisely because it reduces dependence on offshore labour arbitrage. The 1,700 Global Capability Centers exist because of cost arbitrage; as AI eliminates that advantage, the rationale for large Indian operations diminishes. India's young, growing population—conventionally treated as an advantage—becomes a liability in an AI-disrupted world. A billion people is an asset when you need labour; it becomes a liability when labour is what AI replaces. Add structural dysfunction (corruption, infrastructure gaps, weak state capacity, 80%+ informal economy) and India's trajectory becomes genuinely uncertain. India is classified as "Contested" with projected GDP growth of three to six percent annually—the question being whether India can manage the social consequences of AI eliminating the jobs that built its middle class.

The regional picture reveals divergent paths within shared cultural advantages. China and Australia are clear winners—one through state-directed deployment, one through resource endowment. Japan and Singapore are survivors—one through managed decline with demographic stability, one through technocratic adaptation within binding constraints. India joins Thailand as a contested case where structural vulnerabilities may offset adoption enthusiasm. All benefit from cultural dispositions toward technology adoption that exceed Western levels. None faces the fracturing risk that threatens the United Kingdom and France—though India's path carries higher variance than most. The Asia-Pacific trajectory is not uniformly positive—Japan stagnates, Singapore faces structural challenge, India's services economy may collapse—but it is generally more favourable than what awaits much of Europe.
