# Regional Outlook: The Great Bifurcation

*Asia-Pacific as the primary theatre of the US-China contest.*

## The Strategic Split

The Asia-Pacific region is no longer a single economic zone; it is a contested space fracturing into two distinct technological and economic spheres. By 2030, this bifurcation will be the defining feature of the regional economy.

### The US Alliance Block
**Core Members:** Japan, Australia, South Korea, Taiwan
**Key Characteristics:**
- Integrated into US semiconductor supply chains
- Adoption of US-aligned AI standards and platforms
- "Friend-shoring" of critical manufacturing
- Escalating defense integration

### The China Sphere
**Core Members:** Mainland China, Cambodia, Laos, Pakistan
**Key Characteristics:**
- Reliance on domestic Chinese technology stacks (HarmonyOS, Huawei cloud)
- Integration into the Digital Silk Road
- Adoption of Chinese AI standards and surveillance norms
- Commodity suppliers to the Chinese industrial machine

### The Swing States
**Key Players:** Indonesia, Vietnam, India, Malaysia, Thailand
**Strategy:** Aggressive non-alignment. These nations are attempting to play both sides—accepting Chinese infrastructure investment while soliciting US/EU export markets and defense cooperation. This "hedging" strategy becomes increasingly difficult as technology stacks diverge; interoperability costs will eventually force a choice.

## Economic Implications

1.  **Supply Chain Redundancy:** The era of "just-in-time" efficiency is replaced by "just-in-case" resilience. Duplicate supply chains for the US and China markets drive up costs but create massive investment opportunities for Vietnam, India, and Mexico.
2.  **Standards War:** A digital iron curtain is descending. Apps, payment systems, and 5G networks are becoming mutually exclusive. Doing business across the bloc requires dual technology stacks.
3.  **Capital Flows:** Investment is increasingly political. US outbound investment restrictions and Chinese capital controls mean capital flows follow geopolitical alignments, not just yield.

## Falsifiable Criteria
- **Trade volume:** Intra-bloc trade growth exceeds cross-bloc trade growth by >20% by 2028.
- **Tech divergence:** By 2030, >50% of digital transactions in ASEAN utilize distinct, non-interoperable US or Chinese payment/data standards.
- **Supply chains:** Apple/Nvidia supply chains achieve <20% direct reliance on China-based final assembly by 2028.
