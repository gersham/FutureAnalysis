## December 2025 Reality

Pakistan's structural fragility is quantified:

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Population** | ~230 million |
| **GDP growth FY25** | 2.7% (recovery from -0.2% FY23) |
| **IMF programmes since independence** | 24 |
| **External debt service (annual)** | $22-23 billion |
| **Foreign reserves** | ~$14 billion |
| **Energy circular debt** | ~Rs. 2.4 trillion (~$8.6 billion) |
| **Inflation** | <3% headline; ~9% core |
| **Policy rate cuts since June 2025** | 1,100 basis points |

**The trap**: Pakistan's 24th IMF programme since independence. The cycle has become permanent.

## The IMF Cycle

Pakistan has entered its 24th IMF programme since independence—a 37-month Extended Fund Facility that provides temporary stability while accumulating the conditions for the next crisis. Each programme follows the same pattern:

1. Crisis (forex depletion, debt service failure risk)
2. IMF programme (conditions, disbursements)
3. Temporary stabilisation
4. Reform slippage as political costs mount
5. New crisis

The current programme shows the familiar dynamics. The primary surplus of 2.0% of GDP in H1 FY25 demonstrates fiscal effort—but structural reforms (energy sector, tax base expansion, privatisation) face the same political resistance they always have.

## The Debt Wall

External debt service of $22-23 billion annually over FY 2025-2027 dwarfs foreign reserves of ~$14 billion. Pakistan services its debt through:

- IMF disbursements (contingent on programme compliance)
- Chinese rollovers ($3.4 billion in June 2025 alone)
- Saudi/UAE support (contingent on geopolitical alignment)
- Remittances from overseas Pakistanis

This is not a debt stock that can be paid down. It is a rolling crisis managed through continuous external support. Default risk is real—not as immediate event but as constant background threat that shapes all policy.

## The Energy Trap

The energy sector exemplifies Pakistan's structural dysfunction:

- **Circular debt of Rs. 2.4 trillion (~$8.6 billion)**: Accumulated arrears throughout the energy supply chain
- **Expensive generation**: Capacity payments to IPPs even when power isn't needed
- **Subsidies**: Political pressure prevents cost-reflective tariffs
- **Losses**: Theft and transmission losses endemic

The energy crisis is a fiscal crisis is a political crisis. Every solution requires either raising prices (politically impossible), cutting subsidies (also politically impossible), or continuing to accumulate debt (unsustainable).

## Population Without Employment

Pakistan adds millions to its working-age population annually. Where do they work?

- Manufacturing has not scaled (textile sector stagnant, other sectors minimal)
- Services face AI automation
- Agriculture is subsistence-level for most
- The state cannot expand employment
- Gulf migration absorbs some labour but not at scale

Pakistan shares India's demographic profile without India's IT services industry, GCCs, or English-language professional class. If India's IT services model is vulnerable to AI, Pakistan's prospects are worse—it never built the model that's now being disrupted.

## Nuclear Wildcard

Pakistan's nuclear status provides security but not economic benefit. Military expenditure claims resources that might otherwise fund development. The security situation—internal (terrorism, separatism) and external (India, Afghanistan)—consumes governance capacity that the economy needs.

## Outlook Assessment

### Near Term (2026-2028)

- IMF programme continues with periodic slippage
- External debt rolled over through Chinese/Gulf support
- Growth recovers to 2.5-3% (cyclical, not structural)
- Energy circular debt continues accumulating
- Political instability (PTI vs. establishment) consumes governance capacity

### Mid Term (2029-2032)

- Another IMF programme (25th or 26th)
- Debt service continues claiming external revenue
- Energy crisis unresolved
- Youth employment crisis intensifies
- Brain drain accelerates

### Late Term (2033-2036)

**Base case**: Pakistan muddles through—a permanent state of managed crisis rather than development or collapse. GDP growth of 1-3% while population grows 2% annually—per capita stagnation or decline. IMF dependency becomes constitutional rather than exceptional.

**Risk case**: External support falters (Chinese priorities shift, Gulf relationships sour, IMF programme fails). Debt restructuring becomes unavoidable. Political instability intensifies. Pakistan's trajectory parallels Sri Lanka 2022 rather than managed stagnation.

## Classification Rationale

**"Declining"** because:

1. **Structural debt trap**: 24 IMF programmes is not bad luck; it's structural incapacity
2. **Energy dysfunction**: Circular debt is symptom of political economy that cannot reform
3. **Population liability**: Growing workforce with no employment absorption mechanism
4. **Governance failure**: State capacity consumed by security, politics, and crisis management
5. **No alternative path**: Neither manufacturing nor services developed; agriculture is subsistence

If India is "Contested" due to IT services vulnerability and structural challenges, Pakistan is "Declining"—the same challenges without the services industry, GCCs, or governance capacity that give India any chance of adaptation.
