## December 2025 Reality

India's headline numbers mask structural vulnerability:

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **GDP growth FY 2025-26** | 6.5-6.9% projected |
| **Q1 FY25-26 growth** | 7.8% YoY |
| **Global ranking** | 4th largest economy |
| **Enterprise AI adoption** | 92% |
| **IT services exports** | ~$200 billion annually |
| **IT services employment** | ~5 million direct, ~15 million indirect |
| **GDP per capita** | ~$2,500 (vs China ~$13,000) |

**The vulnerability**: India's technology services industry—the backbone of middle-class prosperity—is precisely what AI disrupts first.

## The IT Services Trap

India's economic success story of the past three decades rests on IT services outsourcing: call centers, business process outsourcing, software maintenance, back-office operations, and technical support. This industry employs approximately 5 million directly and 15 million indirectly, generating ~$200 billion in exports and forming the foundation of India's urban middle class.

Every one of these functions is amenable to AI automation.

| Function | AI Capability | Timeline |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Call centers | Already being replaced | Now |
| Business process outsourcing | Highly automatable | 2025-2027 |
| Software maintenance | AI coding assistants | 2025-2028 |
| Technical support | AI chatbots/agents | Now |
| Back-office operations | Document processing AI | 2025-2027 |
| Data entry/processing | Near-complete automation | Now |

The cruel irony: India's high AI adoption metrics (92% enterprise adoption) may reflect companies *using* AI to automate the very Indian workforce they previously employed. Western firms enthusiastic about AI are enthusiastic precisely because it reduces their dependence on offshore labour arbitrage.

## The GCC Illusion

The 1,700 Global Capability Centers operational in India are often cited as evidence of structural integration with global technology ecosystems. But GCCs exist because of labour cost arbitrage. As AI eliminates the cost advantage of Indian labour, the rationale for maintaining large Indian operations diminishes.

GCCs will not disappear overnight, but they will:
- Shrink headcount dramatically as AI handles routine tasks
- Shift toward smaller, highly-skilled teams
- Reduce the employment multiplier that benefits the broader economy

The GCCs that remain will employ thousands, not hundreds of thousands.

## Demographics: Asset or Liability?

The conventional narrative treats India's young, growing population as an advantage. In an AI-disrupted world, this calculus inverts.

**The old logic**: Large working-age population = labour supply = economic growth

**The new logic**: Large working-age population = mass unemployment = social instability

India adds approximately 12 million people to its workforce annually. If AI eliminates the IT services and BPO jobs that absorbed educated workers, where do these millions go? Manufacturing has not scaled. Agriculture cannot absorb more labour. The informal sector already employs 80%+ of the workforce.

A billion people is an asset when you need labour. It becomes a liability when labour is what AI replaces.

## Structural Dysfunction

India's challenges extend beyond AI disruption:

**Corruption**: Transparency International ranks India 93rd globally. Regulatory capture, bureaucratic extraction, and crony capitalism impede efficient resource allocation. The structural reforms needed to pivot the economy face entrenched opposition.

**Infrastructure**: Power reliability, logistics networks, port capacity, and physical infrastructure lag China by decades. Building AI-era infrastructure requires governance capacity India has not demonstrated.

**State capacity**: The Indian state struggles to deliver basic services—education, healthcare, sanitation—to its population. Managing an AI-driven economic transition requires administrative capability that does not exist at scale.

**Inequality**: India's Gini coefficient and wealth concentration mean AI gains will accrue to a small educated elite while the vast majority sees disruption without compensation. This is a recipe for social instability, not shared prosperity.

**Informal economy**: Over 80% of Indian workers are in the informal sector, outside the organised economy where productivity gains might be captured. AI benefits formal sector productivity; it does nothing for subsistence agriculture or informal urban labour.

## Applying the Displacement Model

### Step 1: Sector Exposure

India’s growth model concentrates exposure in IT and business services:

| Sector | Role in Economy | Expected Displacement/Year | Exposure |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------------|----------|
| IT services / BPO / GCCs | Core export and middle-class employer | Well above baseline | **Very High** |
| Public sector & regulated professions | Large but slower to automate | Around/below baseline | Moderate |
| Manufacturing | Underdeveloped relative to scale | Later robotics wave; limited near‑term | Low‑Moderate |
| Agriculture & informal services | Dominant employer; low productivity | Mostly bypassed by AI | Low (for AI), high (for social risk) |

Relative to the 5% scenario baseline, India is unusually exposed at the high‑skill services end and unusually underdeveloped in the sectors that could absorb displaced workers.

### Step 2: Factor Analysis

Using the [archetype framework](../../../METHODOLOGY.md), India is an "emerging market":

| Factor | India’s Position | Interpretation |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Compute access | Improving but constrained | Some hyperscaler presence; grid and policy limit rapid scale‑up |
| Energy cost/reliability | Mixed | Cheap coal power but unreliable infrastructure and losses |
| Regulatory environment | Complex | Heavy bureaucracy; reform efforts; uneven enforcement |
| Capital markets | Shallow relative to needs | Limited domestic risk capital; relies on FDI and external funding |
| Talent base | Large but uneven | Many STEM graduates; quality and employability vary widely |
| Cultural adoption | High | Strong enthusiasm for technology and digital public infrastructure |

**Interpretation**: India combines high cultural/firm‑level adoption and a large potential talent pool with weak state capacity, shallow capital markets, and infrastructure constraints. This widens the range between upside and downside paths.

### Step 3: Binding Constraints

India’s binding constraints in this scenario:
1. **Over‑reliance on IT services**: A single, highly automatable export engine anchors urban prosperity.
2. **State capacity**: Limited ability to deliver large‑scale retraining, safety nets, or industrial policy at speed.
3. **Informality**: 80%+ of workers in the informal sector blunts productivity gains and complicates support.
4. **Demographics**: Massive cohort of young workers without obvious high‑productivity destinations.

### Step 4: Outcome in the 5% Scenario

Combining sector exposure and the factor bundle:
- A large share of India’s formal, high‑productivity employment base sits directly in AI’s line of fire.
- The state’s ability to coordinate a manufacturing pivot or social response is limited.
- Cultural and firm‑level adoption provide real upside if governance and capital constraints are overcome.

→ Under the 5%‑per‑year displacement scenario, India fits the **Contested** category in the [outcome schema](../../../METHODOLOGY.md): growth outcomes ranging from robust (5–6%) to stressed (3% or lower), unemployment and underemployment that can swing quickly, and a legitimacy trajectory that could stabilise through adaptation or tilt toward serious unrest depending on execution.

## The Optimistic Case (Weakened)

The bull case for India rests on:

1. **Cultural enthusiasm for technology**: 92% adoption rates suggest willingness to embrace AI
2. **English proficiency**: Enables integration with global AI development
3. **Digital public infrastructure**: UPI, Aadhaar provide platforms for AI deployment
4. **STEM graduates**: 2.6 million annually provides talent pipeline
5. **Government initiatives**: IndiaAI Mission, semiconductor investments

But enthusiasm for technology does not help when technology eliminates your job. English proficiency matters less when AI handles customer interactions. STEM graduates need employment destinations that may not exist.

## Outlook Assessment

### Near Term (2026-2028)

- IT services employment begins visible contraction
- GDP growth moderates to 5-6% as services drag appears
- Urban unemployment rises among educated youth
- Government announces support programmes; execution unclear
- Social tensions emerge in IT hub cities (Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune)

### Mid Term (2029-2032)

- IT services sector contracts 30-50% from peak employment
- Manufacturing fails to absorb displaced workers at scale
- Informal sector swells further
- Political instability increases; populist movements gain strength
- Brain drain accelerates as skilled workers emigrate

### Late Term (2033-2036)

**Optimistic scenario**: India successfully pivots to AI-native services, manufacturing scales with automation, and governance capacity improves. GDP growth sustains 5-6%. Achievable but requires execution India has not historically demonstrated.

**Base case**: IT services collapse creates prolonged adjustment. GDP growth falls to 3-4%. Urban unemployment becomes structural. Political instability increases but does not fracture the state. India remains poor but stable.

**Pessimistic scenario**: Mass unemployment combines with existing caste/religious tensions. Social instability spreads. Governance capacity proves inadequate. GDP growth falls below 3%. India becomes an example of how large populations become liabilities in the AI era.

---

## Classification Rationale

**"Contested"** because:

1. **Genuine uncertainty**: The IT services disruption thesis is clear; India's response capacity is not
2. **High variance outcomes**: Scenarios range from successful pivot to social instability
3. **Structural constraints**: Corruption, infrastructure, state capacity limit adaptation
4. **Demographic double-edge**: Young population is liability if jobs disappear
5. **Execution track record**: India has not demonstrated capacity for rapid economic transformation

India's AI enthusiasm may prove to be measuring the enthusiasm of those about to be disrupted. The question is not whether India adopts AI—it will. The question is whether India can manage the social consequences of AI eliminating the jobs that built its middle class.

## Geopolitical Weight: The Tiebreaker (Added December 2025)

The December 2025 US NSS and leaked "Core 5" proposal reveal India's unique strategic position: **the only major power with genuine choice between blocs**.

**India's C5 credentials:**

| Factor | Status | Implication |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Population** | 1.4 billion (largest by 2030) | Demographic mass regardless of per-capita income |
| **Nuclear arsenal** | 150+ warheads | Great power entry ticket |
| **Indian Ocean control** | Geographic dominance of critical trade routes | Chokepoint for China's sea lanes |
| **Non-aligned tradition** | QUAD member + BRICS member + SCO member | Genuine options on both sides |
| **Bloc swing vote** | Neither US nor China can dominate without India | Maximum leverage through ambiguity |

**The tiebreaker logic:**

In a C5 world structured as US-Japan vs China-Russia, India is the decisive fifth vote:
- **US alignment**: Tips balance decisively toward Western-led order; constrains China in Indo-Pacific
- **China alignment**: Creates Eurasian bloc with population >3 billion; isolates US/Japan
- **Non-alignment**: Preserves optionality; extracts concessions from both sides

India's "contested" economic status becomes a *feature* geopolitically: neither bloc can take India for granted, so both must court it.

**The economic-geopolitical divergence:**

| Dimension | Assessment | Trajectory |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Economic** | IT services collapse, structural dysfunction, contested | Could go either way |
| **Geopolitical** | Elevated, maximum optionality, indispensable | Rising regardless of economics |

India can be economically struggling while geopolitically ascendant. In a multipolar world, being the swing state matters more than GDP growth.

**What this changes:**

1. **India's "contested" status is strategic advantage**, not just economic uncertainty
2. **Both blocs will invest in India** to prevent defection to the other
3. **India can extract technology transfers, investment, security guarantees** by playing sides
4. **Economic dysfunction may be tolerated** by both blocs to maintain strategic alignment

**The historical parallel**: Cold War non-aligned movement gave India leverage despite economic underperformance. C5 framework could recreate similar dynamics at higher stakes.

**Implication for our analysis**: India's contested economic outlook coexists with elevated geopolitical standing. The IT services collapse may matter less than India's vote on great power questions.

## Implications

### For Global Companies

- Reduce long-term dependence on Indian labour arbitrage
- Expect IT services contracts to be renegotiated or automated
- GCC strategies should assume significant headcount reduction
- Alternative locations (Philippines, Vietnam, Eastern Europe) face similar dynamics

### For Indian Businesses

- IT services model faces existential pressure
- Pivot to AI-native offerings requires capabilities most firms lack
- Domestic market growth constrained by mass unemployment
- Manufacturing automation may not absorb displaced services workers

### For Individuals

- IT services careers face structural decline, not cyclical downturn
- Emigration becomes increasingly attractive for skilled workers
- Domestic opportunities concentrate in narrow elite segments
- Skills in AI development (not deployment) offer some protection
