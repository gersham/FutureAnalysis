## December 2025 Reality

India's headline numbers mask structural vulnerability:

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **GDP growth FY 2025-26** | 6.5-6.9% projected |
| **Q1 FY25-26 growth** | 7.8% YoY |
| **Global ranking** | 4th largest economy |
| **Enterprise AI adoption** | 92% |
| **IT services exports** | ~$200 billion annually |
| **IT services employment** | ~5 million direct, ~15 million indirect |
| **GDP per capita** | ~$2,500 (vs China ~$13,000) |

**The vulnerability**: India's technology services industry—the backbone of middle-class prosperity—is precisely what AI disrupts first.

## The IT Services Trap

India's economic success story of the past three decades rests on IT services outsourcing: call centers, business process outsourcing, software maintenance, back-office operations, and technical support. This industry employs approximately 5 million directly and 15 million indirectly, generating ~$200 billion in exports and forming the foundation of India's urban middle class.

Every one of these functions is amenable to AI automation.

| Function | AI Capability | Timeline |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Call centers | Already being replaced | Now |
| Business process outsourcing | Highly automatable | 2025-2027 |
| Software maintenance | AI coding assistants | 2025-2028 |
| Technical support | AI chatbots/agents | Now |
| Back-office operations | Document processing AI | 2025-2027 |
| Data entry/processing | Near-complete automation | Now |

The cruel irony: India's high AI adoption metrics (92% enterprise adoption) may reflect companies *using* AI to automate the very Indian workforce they previously employed. Western firms enthusiastic about AI are enthusiastic precisely because it reduces their dependence on offshore labour arbitrage.

## The GCC Illusion

The 1,700 Global Capability Centers operational in India are often cited as evidence of structural integration with global technology ecosystems. But GCCs exist because of labour cost arbitrage. As AI eliminates the cost advantage of Indian labour, the rationale for maintaining large Indian operations diminishes.

GCCs will not disappear overnight, but they will:
- Shrink headcount dramatically as AI handles routine tasks
- Shift toward smaller, highly-skilled teams
- Reduce the employment multiplier that benefits the broader economy

The GCCs that remain will employ thousands, not hundreds of thousands.

## Demographics: Asset or Liability?

The conventional narrative treats India's young, growing population as an advantage. In an AI-disrupted world, this calculus inverts.

**The old logic**: Large working-age population = labour supply = economic growth

**The new logic**: Large working-age population = mass unemployment = social instability

India adds approximately 12 million people to its workforce annually. If AI eliminates the IT services and BPO jobs that absorbed educated workers, where do these millions go? Manufacturing has not scaled. Agriculture cannot absorb more labour. The informal sector already employs 80%+ of the workforce.

A billion people is an asset when you need labour. It becomes a liability when labour is what AI replaces.

## Structural Dysfunction

India's challenges extend beyond AI disruption:

**Corruption**: Transparency International ranks India 93rd globally. Regulatory capture, bureaucratic extraction, and crony capitalism impede efficient resource allocation. The structural reforms needed to pivot the economy face entrenched opposition.

**Infrastructure**: Power reliability, logistics networks, port capacity, and physical infrastructure lag China by decades. Building AI-era infrastructure requires governance capacity India has not demonstrated.

**State capacity**: The Indian state struggles to deliver basic services—education, healthcare, sanitation—to its population. Managing an AI-driven economic transition requires administrative capability that does not exist at scale.

**Inequality**: India's Gini coefficient and wealth concentration mean AI gains will accrue to a small educated elite while the vast majority sees disruption without compensation. This is a recipe for social instability, not shared prosperity.

**Informal economy**: Over 80% of Indian workers are in the informal sector, outside the organised economy where productivity gains might be captured. AI benefits formal sector productivity; it does nothing for subsistence agriculture or informal urban labour.

## The Optimistic Case (Weakened)

The bull case for India rests on:

1. **Cultural enthusiasm for technology**: 92% adoption rates suggest willingness to embrace AI
2. **English proficiency**: Enables integration with global AI development
3. **Digital public infrastructure**: UPI, Aadhaar provide platforms for AI deployment
4. **STEM graduates**: 2.6 million annually provides talent pipeline
5. **Government initiatives**: IndiaAI Mission, semiconductor investments

But enthusiasm for technology does not help when technology eliminates your job. English proficiency matters less when AI handles customer interactions. STEM graduates need employment destinations that may not exist.

## Outlook Assessment

### Near Term (2026-2028)

- IT services employment begins visible contraction
- GDP growth moderates to 5-6% as services drag appears
- Urban unemployment rises among educated youth
- Government announces support programmes; execution unclear
- Social tensions emerge in IT hub cities (Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune)

### Mid Term (2029-2032)

- IT services sector contracts 30-50% from peak employment
- Manufacturing fails to absorb displaced workers at scale
- Informal sector swells further
- Political instability increases; populist movements gain strength
- Brain drain accelerates as skilled workers emigrate

### Late Term (2033-2036)

**Optimistic scenario**: India successfully pivots to AI-native services, manufacturing scales with automation, and governance capacity improves. GDP growth sustains 5-6%. Achievable but requires execution India has not historically demonstrated.

**Base case**: IT services collapse creates prolonged adjustment. GDP growth falls to 3-4%. Urban unemployment becomes structural. Political instability increases but does not fracture the state. India remains poor but stable.

**Pessimistic scenario**: Mass unemployment combines with existing caste/religious tensions. Social instability spreads. Governance capacity proves inadequate. GDP growth falls below 3%. India becomes an example of how large populations become liabilities in the AI era.

---

## Classification Rationale

**"Contested"** because:

1. **Genuine uncertainty**: The IT services disruption thesis is clear; India's response capacity is not
2. **High variance outcomes**: Scenarios range from successful pivot to social instability
3. **Structural constraints**: Corruption, infrastructure, state capacity limit adaptation
4. **Demographic double-edge**: Young population is liability if jobs disappear
5. **Execution track record**: India has not demonstrated capacity for rapid economic transformation

India's AI enthusiasm may prove to be measuring the enthusiasm of those about to be disrupted. The question is not whether India adopts AI—it will. The question is whether India can manage the social consequences of AI eliminating the jobs that built its middle class.

## Implications

### For Global Companies

- Reduce long-term dependence on Indian labour arbitrage
- Expect IT services contracts to be renegotiated or automated
- GCC strategies should assume significant headcount reduction
- Alternative locations (Philippines, Vietnam, Eastern Europe) face similar dynamics

### For Indian Businesses

- IT services model faces existential pressure
- Pivot to AI-native offerings requires capabilities most firms lack
- Domestic market growth constrained by mass unemployment
- Manufacturing automation may not absorb displaced services workers

### For Individuals

- IT services careers face structural decline, not cyclical downturn
- Emigration becomes increasingly attractive for skilled workers
- Domestic opportunities concentrate in narrow elite segments
- Skills in AI development (not deployment) offer some protection
