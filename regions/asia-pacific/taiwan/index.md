## December 2025 Reality

Taiwan is the semiconductor chokepoint of the AI era:

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Global semiconductor production share** | >60% |
| **Advanced chips (7nm and below)** | 92% |
| **TSMC market cap** | $1 trillion (July 2025) |
| **Semiconductor share of GDP** | 18% |
| **Semiconductor share of exports** | 60% |
| **TSMC US investment (announced)** | $165 billion total |
| **Distance from China** | <100 miles |

**The paradox**: Taiwan makes the chips that power AI. If China invades, the global economy loses $5 trillion in year one.

## The Silicon Shield

Taiwan's semiconductor dominance has been framed as a "silicon shield"—the theory that Taiwan's indispensability to the global economy deters Chinese invasion. The logic: no rational actor would destroy the infrastructure their own economy depends upon.

The shield has three components:

1. **Production concentration**: 92% of advanced chips come from Taiwan
2. **TSMC irreplaceability**: No other company can produce at TSMC's scale and capability
3. **Global dependency**: US, Chinese, and global tech sectors all require Taiwanese chips

Poll data from February 2025 shows 84% of Taiwanese believe the semiconductor industry helps protect Taiwan, and a majority believe Western countries would aid Taiwan if attacked.

## The Shield Weakens

Several factors erode the silicon shield's protective value:

**TSMC globalisation**: The $165 billion Arizona investment (six fabs, two packaging facilities, R&D centre), plus expansion in Japan and Germany, gradually disperses capability. Taiwan's share of advanced production will decline as these facilities come online through 2030.

**US-China decoupling**: American policy explicitly aims to reduce dependence on Taiwanese production. The CHIPS Act subsidises domestic capacity. "Friendshoring" moves supply chains to allied nations. The goal is resilience against Taiwan disruption—which reduces Taiwan's strategic leverage.

**Chinese capability growth**: While China remains years behind on advanced nodes, domestic semiconductor investment continues. Export controls slow but do not stop Chinese advancement.

The shield is weakening precisely because it worked too well. Taiwan's indispensability became a vulnerability that all major powers are now working to reduce.

## The China Risk

Taiwan's trajectory depends more on decisions made in Beijing than in Taipei.

**Invasion scenario**: Full amphibious invasion is militarily difficult but not impossible. Cost would be catastrophic—Bloomberg Economics estimates $5 trillion to the global economy in year one. Taiwan would likely be destroyed as a functional economy regardless of military outcome.

**Blockade scenario**: Naval blockade of Taiwan is militarily easier than invasion. Semiconductor exports halt. Taiwan's economy collapses. Global chip shortage is immediate and severe.

**Coercion scenario**: Increasing military pressure, economic sanctions, and diplomatic isolation without kinetic conflict. Taiwan remains functional but constrained. Investment flows slow as risk premium rises.

The probability of kinetic conflict is unknowable. Xi Jinping has stated reunification cannot be "passed down generation after generation." Whether this implies a timeline—and whether that timeline involves force—depends on calculations internal to the CCP leadership.

## Economic Position Ex-China Risk

Setting aside geopolitical risk, Taiwan's economic position is strong:

- Semiconductor dominance generates enormous value
- TSMC employment and supply chain anchor the economy
- High education levels and tech expertise
- Advanced chip manufacturing is AI-era comparative advantage

If the China risk didn't exist, Taiwan would be an unambiguous winner. But the risk does exist, and it dominates all other considerations.

## Outlook Assessment

### Near Term (2026-2028)

- TSMC continues capacity expansion (Taiwan and global)
- China risk persists but no kinetic conflict (base case)
- Semiconductor revenue strong driven by AI demand
- Investment flows continue but risk-adjusted
- US pressure for supply chain diversification intensifies

### Mid Term (2029-2032)

- Arizona, Japan, Germany facilities reach scale
- Taiwan's share of advanced production declines (still dominant but less so)
- Silicon shield erodes as alternatives exist
- China decision point: does the shield erosion make conflict more or less likely?

### Late Term (2033-2036)

**Optimistic scenario**: Deterrence holds. Taiwan remains semiconductor leader (though smaller share). Economy thrives on AI-era chip demand. GDP growth of 4-5% annually.

**Base case**: Status quo continues. Taiwan functions under constant China pressure. Investment constrained by geopolitical risk. GDP growth of 2-4%.

**Risk scenario**: Kinetic conflict or blockade. Taiwan's economy is destroyed regardless of military outcome. Global semiconductor supply disrupted catastrophically.

---

## Classification Rationale

**"Contested"** because:

1. **Binary geopolitical risk**: China scenario dominates all economic factors
2. **Unknowable probability**: CCP decision-making is opaque
3. **Extreme variance**: Outcomes range from "thriving AI-era winner" to "destroyed by conflict"
4. **Eroding shield**: Strategic position weakening as production disperses
5. **External dependency**: Outcome depends on Beijing, Washington, not Taipei

Taiwan is the most extreme contested case. Economic fundamentals are strong; geopolitical risk is existential. No confident forecast is possible because the determining variable—CCP intentions and calculations—cannot be assessed with confidence.

## Implications

### For Global Tech Companies

- TSMC dependency remains unavoidable near-term
- Diversification to Arizona, Japan, Germany reduces (doesn't eliminate) risk
- Contingency planning for Taiwan disruption is essential
- No alternative for leading-edge chips before 2030

### For Investors

- Taiwan investments carry geopolitical risk premium
- Semiconductor exposure is AI-era necessity and Taiwan risk
- Risk/reward calculus depends on China scenario probability assessment

### For Individuals (in Taiwan)

- Semiconductor careers remain valuable while status quo holds
- Emigration option increasingly exercised by those with mobility
- Domestic politics less determinative than geopolitical context
