## December 2025 Reality

Thailand shows digital strength but economic weakness:

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **GDP growth 2025** | 2.0-2.4% |
| **2026 projection** | 1.6-1.9% (IMF/BoT) |
| **Digital sector growth** | 7.3% ($140.3 billion) |
| **AI market 2025** | $1.16 billion |
| **Digital economy share** | ~6% of GDP |
| **AI investment mobilization** | ฿500 billion (~$14.3 billion) |

**EV momentum**: 27 companies scaling manufacturing under revised EV3/EV3.5 incentives.

**Warning signs**: High household debt; structural weaknesses; only 2.4% GDP growth in first three quarters.

Thailand presents a genuinely contested case—digital economy strength and EV manufacturing momentum offset by structural weaknesses that constrain overall growth. The economy grew only 2.4% in the first three quarters of 2025, with full-year expectations around 2% and 2026 projected even lower (1.6%). Yet the digital sector grows at 7.3% and EV investment accelerates.

The digital economy provides Thailand's brightest spot. At $140.3 billion (7.3% growth), Thailand's digital sector dramatically outpaces overall GDP growth (2.8%). The AI market is projected to reach $1.16 billion by 2025 with 26% annual growth through 2031. The National AI Committee targets training 10 million AI users, 90,000 professionals, and 50,000 developers, backed by ฿500 billion ($14.3 billion) in mobilized investment.

EV manufacturing is Thailand's industrial bet. The revised EV3 and EV3.5 incentive packages have spurred 27 companies to scale up manufacturing. Thailand aims to become Southeast Asia's EV hub, leveraging existing automotive industry infrastructure. HEV and BEV segments continue growing even as overall car market softens.

**But structural weaknesses are real**:
- Household debt: High debt levels constrain consumption
- Geopolitical exposure: US tariffs could cap growth
- Demographics: Aging population
- Political uncertainty: Recent turbulence affects policy consistency
- Export dependency: Vulnerable to demand in US/China

**Near term (2026-2028)**: Digital and EV sectors grow while overall economy underperforms. GDP stays in 1.5-2.5% range. Structural challenges persist.

**Mid term (2029-2032)**: Decisive period. Either: Digital/EV investments translate to broader productivity gains; or structural constraints cap growth despite sectoral strength.

**Late term (2033-2036)**: Outcome visibility. Success: Thailand emerges as regional digital/EV hub with 3-4% sustained growth. Risk: Continues as low-growth economy with pockets of excellence but structural stagnation.

**Classification rationale**: "Contested" because digital strength is real but structural constraints are also real. The determining factors (debt resolution, policy consistency, trade relations) cannot be confidently forecast.
