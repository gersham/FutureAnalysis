# Australia Outlook: 2026-2036

> **Classification**: Winner (Contingent)
> **GDP Projection**: +3 to +5% annually
> **Confidence**: Moderate
> **Contingency**: Regulatory choices

## Core Assessment

Australia is unexpectedly advantaged by geography and geology. Critical minerals for AI hardware, uranium for nuclear power, natural gas for electricity generation, and vast solar potential for data centre operations—all in a politically stable jurisdiction with a small population to support. The services economy in Sydney and Melbourne will suffer, but resource exports will more than compensate if regulatory choices permit.

## Why Contingent Winner

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Resource endowment | Exceptional |
| Energy potential | Very high |
| Data centre growth | Strong (4-5 GW by 2030) |
| Services vulnerability | Real but offset |
| **Regulatory risk** | Key swing factor |

Australia could be a clear winner or merely a survivor depending on policy choices.

## Predictions by Period

### Near Term (2026-2028)

| Prediction | Criterion | Confidence |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Resource exports grow | Critical minerals exports +20% | High |
| Data centre expansion continues | Capacity exceeds 2 GW | High |
| Services sector pressure | Sydney/Melbourne services employment -5% | Moderate |
| Regulatory direction clarifies | AI governance framework finalised | Moderate |

### Mid Term (2029-2032)

| Prediction | Criterion | Confidence |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Resources dominant | Mining/energy exceed 15% of GDP | Moderate |
| Data centres scaled | Capacity approaches 4 GW | Moderate |
| Geographic divergence | Resource areas outperform cities | Moderate |
| Policy effects visible | Regulation helps or hinders growth | Moderate |

### Late Term (2033-2036)

| Prediction | Criterion | Confidence |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Winner outcome (if permissive) | GDP +4-5% annually | Moderate |
| Survivor outcome (if restrictive) | GDP +2-3% annually | Moderate |
| Services adapted | Smaller but stabilised | Moderate |
| Resource dominance | Clear economic engine | High |

## Scenarios

### Best Case: Permissive Regulation
- Full resource advantage captured
- Data centres expand to 5+ GW
- AI productivity gains captured
- Services adjustment but net growth
- GDP: +4-5% annually

### Middle Case: Moderate Regulation
- Resource advantage captured
- Data centre growth constrained
- Partial AI gains
- Services struggle
- GDP: +3-4% annually

### Worst Case: EU-Style Regulation
- Resource advantage only
- AI gains forfeited
- Services decline not offset
- Still positive due to resources
- GDP: +2-3% annually

All scenarios are positive due to resources; the range depends on policy.
