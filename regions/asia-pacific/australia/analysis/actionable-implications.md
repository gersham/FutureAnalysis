# Actionable Implications

*Strategic considerations for those in or connected to Australia.*

## For Individuals

### Geographic Positioning

| Location | Outlook |
|----------|---------|
| Sydney CBD services | Vulnerable |
| Melbourne CBD services | Vulnerable |
| Resource regions (WA, QLD) | Advantaged |
| Regional centres | Mixed |

Consider whether services career in major cities aligns with structural trends.

### Career Considerations

| Sector | Outlook |
|--------|---------|
| Resources/mining | Strong growth |
| Energy | Strong growth |
| Professional services | Vulnerable |
| Financial services | Vulnerable |
| Healthcare | Moderate, aging population |
| Data centre/tech infrastructure | Growth potential |

### Living Standards

Australia's overall trajectory is positive:
- Resource wealth supports national prosperity
- Services pressure affects specific cities/sectors
- Quality of life likely maintained nationally
- Inequality may increase (resource vs. service regions)

## For Businesses

### Strategic Positioning

| Sector | Strategy |
|--------|----------|
| Resources | Expansion; AI adoption |
| Energy | Growth; data centre supply |
| Services | Adaptation; AI integration |
| Infrastructure | Data centre investment |

### Policy Monitoring

| Watch For | Implication |
|-----------|-------------|
| AI regulation framework | Determines infrastructure trajectory |
| Energy policy | Nuclear decision affects long-term capacity |
| Critical minerals policy | Shapes export opportunity |
| Immigration policy | Affects services labour supply |

## For Investors

### Consider

| Asset Class | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| Australian resources | Structural tailwind |
| Critical minerals producers | AI economy essential |
| Energy infrastructure | Growing demand |
| Data centre REITs | Capacity expansion |

### Watch

- AUD trajectory (resource-linked)
- Regulatory developments
- Services sector employment

### Reduce

- Concentrated Sydney/Melbourne services exposure
- Financial services without adaptation strategy

## Comparative Position

| Factor | Australia | Canada | US |
|--------|-----------|--------|-----|
| Resources | Excellent | Excellent | Good |
| AI infrastructure | Growing | Growing | Dominant |
| Services risk | Real | Real | Mixed |
| Regulatory risk | Present | Present | Lower |
| Outlook | Winner (contingent) | Restructured | Winner |

Australia's trajectory is positive but not as dominant as US.

## Timeline

| Period | Key Considerations |
|--------|-------------------|
| 2026-2028 | Watch regulatory direction; position for resources |
| 2029-2032 | Policy effects become clear |
| 2033-2036 | New equilibrium; winner or survivor status confirmed |
