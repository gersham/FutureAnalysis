# Regulatory Risk

*The potential to forfeit geographic advantages.*

## The European Trap

Australia shows signs of following the European regulatory model:
- Similar political culture
- Similar regulatory instincts
- Similar precautionary tendencies

If Australia follows the EU AI Act approach, it may impose costs without preventing AI deployment by competitors.

## Early Indicators

| Signal | Status |
|--------|--------|
| AI governance framework | In development |
| Data protection approach | EU-influenced |
| Technology regulation | Trending restrictive |
| Business sentiment | Mixed |

## Why This Matters

| If Permissive | If Restrictive |
|---------------|----------------|
| Resources + AI infrastructure | Resources only |
| Data centres expand | Growth constrained |
| Captures productivity gains | Forfeits productivity gains |
| Winner trajectory | Survivor trajectory |

Australia's geographic advantages are contingent on policy choices.

## The Risk

| Scenario | Probability | Effect |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Permissive approach | Moderate | Full advantage captured |
| Moderate regulation | Moderate | Partial advantage |
| EU-style regulation | Moderate | Advantage forfeited |

Australia could fumble its geographic advantages through regulatory choices.

## Key Variable

Regulatory trajectory is the swing factor:
- Resources advantage is locked in
- AI/infrastructure advantage is policy-dependent
- Services vulnerability exists regardless
- Net outcome depends on policy choices
