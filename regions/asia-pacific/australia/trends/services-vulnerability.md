# Services Sector Vulnerability

*The other side of Australia's story.*

## Services Economy

| Sector | Share of GDP | Vulnerability |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Financial services | ~9% | High |
| Professional services | Significant | High |
| Healthcare | Growing | Moderate |
| Education | Significant | Moderate |

Australia's major cities—Sydney and Melbourne—are services economies vulnerable to AI automation.

## Geographic Divide

| Location | Economic Base | AI Outlook |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Sydney/Melbourne | Services | Vulnerable |
| Queensland/WA | Resources | Advantaged |
| Regional | Mixed | Variable |

The resource boom bypasses the services economy of the major cities.

## Employment Impact

| Effect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Sydney CBD | Significant displacement |
| Melbourne CBD | Significant displacement |
| Regional resource areas | Less affected |
| National aggregate | Mixed; resources offset services |

## Why This Matters

Australia's resources advantage is real, but:
- Most Australians live in services-dependent cities
- Job creation in resources is capital-intensive, not labour-intensive
- Wealth concentration possible: resources boom, services bust
- National statistics may mask regional/urban divergence
