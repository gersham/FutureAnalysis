## December 2025 Reality

Vietnam's growth numbers require scrutiny:

| Metric | Status | Caveat |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Q3 2025 GDP growth** | 8.23% | Pre-tariff; transshipment-inflated |
| **Full year target** | 8%+ | PM Chinh: now "difficult" |
| **World Bank projection** | 6.6% | Revised down from higher estimates |
| **FDI (10 months 2025)** | $31.52 billion | Includes Chinese transshipment operations |
| **Transshipment share** | 16-42% of exports | Harvard/US estimates vary |
| **New tariff rate** | 20% + 40% transshipment penalty | July 2025 deal |

**Critical question**: How much of Vietnam's growth is genuine manufacturing versus Chinese relabeling to avoid tariffs?

## The Transshipment Problem

Vietnam's growth story has a significant asterisk: an unknown but substantial portion of its export success represents Chinese goods relabeled as Vietnamese to avoid US tariffs on China.

**US Trade Representative estimates**: Approximately one-third of Vietnamese exports to the US are transshipped Chinese goods with minimal value added in Vietnam.

**Academic research**: Harvard studies estimate 16-42% transshipment rates, depending on methodology and product category.

**The mechanism**: Chinese companies establish operations in Vietnam, import components or near-finished goods from China, add minimal value (sometimes just repackaging), and export as "Made in Vietnam" to access preferential tariff rates.

**July 2025 tariff deal**: The US-Vietnam agreement imposed 20% tariffs on Vietnamese goods plus a 40% penalty on identified transshipments. This directly targets the arbitrage that drove part of Vietnam's growth.

**PM Pham Minh Chinh's acknowledgment**: The 8.5% growth target is now "difficult"—a rare public admission from Vietnamese leadership that conditions have changed.

## What's Real vs. What's Transshipment

### Genuine Manufacturing Strength

Vietnam has developed real manufacturing capacity:
- Samsung's smartphone manufacturing (largest contributor to exports)
- Intel's testing and assembly facility
- Electronics supply chain development
- Textile and garment manufacturing (domestic and regional supply chains)

### Transshipment-Inflated Sectors

Higher transshipment risk in:
- Solar panels and components
- Steel and aluminum products
- Electronic components (vs. finished electronics)
- Machinery and parts
- Some consumer goods categories

### The Uncertainty

The honest answer is that distinguishing genuine Vietnamese manufacturing from Chinese transshipment is difficult. FDI numbers include both Samsung building real factories and Chinese firms establishing shell operations. Export growth includes both.

## Revised Outlook

### Near Term (2026-2028)

- GDP growth slows to 5-6% as tariffs bite
- Transshipment operations close or restructure
- Genuine manufacturing continues but at slower pace
- FDI quality matters more than FDI quantity
- Trade authorities attempt to police transshipment

### Mid Term (2029-2032)

**Optimistic scenario**: Transshipment crackdown leaves genuine manufacturing intact. Vietnam's real competitive advantages (location, workforce, improving infrastructure) sustain 5-6% growth. Value chain ascent continues in legitimate sectors.

**Base case**: Growth stabilizes at 4-5% once transshipment arbitrage is eliminated. Vietnam remains a legitimate manufacturing destination but the "miracle" narrative fades. Standard emerging market trajectory rather than exceptional performance.

**Risk scenario**: Tariff structures make Vietnam less competitive than alternatives (India, Indonesia, Philippines). Chinese investment pulls back as transshipment becomes untenable. Growth drops to 3-4%.

### Late Term (2033-2036)

Outcome depends on whether Vietnam can build genuine competitive advantages beyond tariff arbitrage. The country has real assets (location, demographics, improving infrastructure) but the growth trajectory of 2020-2025 was partly artificial.

## Classification Rationale

**"Contested" rather than "Winner"** because:

1. **Transshipment uncertainty**: 16-42% of exports may be relabeled Chinese goods
2. **Tariff vulnerability**: 20% + 40% penalties directly target the growth model
3. **Growth revisions**: World Bank and government both revising down
4. **Model question**: How much competitive advantage remains when arbitrage is eliminated?

**Not "Survivor" or "Declining"** because:

1. Genuine manufacturing base exists (Samsung, Intel, etc.)
2. Geographic advantages are real
3. Demographics remain favorable
4. Infrastructure continues improving

Vietnam's trajectory depends on how much of the 2020-2025 growth story was real versus arbitrage. The answer is genuinely uncertain—hence "Contested."
