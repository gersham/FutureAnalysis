# Demographic Management

*Japan's long experience with population decline.*

## Current Demographics

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Population trajectory | Declining |
| Working-age population | Shrinking |
| Median age | Among highest globally |
| Immigration policy | Restrictive |

Japan has been managing demographic decline for decades—longer than any other major economy.

## Adaptation Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Automation | Manufacturing highly automated |
| Workforce participation | Extended working lives |
| Service automation | Gradual adoption |
| Immigration | Limited, targeted |

## AI as Demographic Response

Japan's relatively conservative AI adoption may accelerate from demographic necessity:

| Pressure | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Labour shortage | Automation in services |
| Care burden | Eldercare technology |
| Productivity need | AI-assisted work |

## Why Decline, Not Collapse

Japan demonstrates that demographic decline does not mean social collapse:
- Homogeneous population prevents ethnic conflict
- Strong institutions manage decline
- Cultural preparation for reduced dynamism
- No expectation of rapid growth

## Trajectory

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 2026-2028 | Continued managed decline |
| 2029-2032 | AI adoption may accelerate |
| 2033-2036 | New demographic equilibrium |
