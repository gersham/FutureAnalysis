# State-Directed AI Deployment

*The Party's willingness to direct economic restructuring.*

## State Capacity Advantages

China's authoritarian system enables:

| Action | Democratic Constraint | China Capacity |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| Rapid deployment mandates | Political opposition | Can mandate |
| Social cost absorption | Electoral consequences | Can suppress |
| Labour reallocation | Union/political resistance | Can direct |
| Industry restructuring | Stakeholder opposition | Can impose |

The Party's willingness to absorb short-term pain for strategic advantage gives China options unavailable to democratic competitors.

## Historical Precedents

| Initiative | Approach | Outcome |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Manufacturing buildout | State-directed | Rapid industrialisation |
| Infrastructure investment | Centrally planned | World-class transport |
| EV transition | Industrial policy | Global leadership |
| COVID response | Authoritarian control | Effective suppression |

## AI-Specific Direction

| Element | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| National AI strategy | Explicit goals |
| Funding | State-backed |
| Adoption mandates | Government and SOE |
| Talent development | Educational system |

## Trade-offs

| Advantage | Disadvantage |
|-----------|--------------|
| Speed of deployment | Information suppression |
| Coordination capacity | Innovation constraints |
| Social cost tolerance | Population control costs |
| Long-term planning | Feedback loop suppression |

State capacity enables rapid deployment but creates different vulnerabilities.
