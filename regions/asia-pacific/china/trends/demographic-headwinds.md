# Demographic Headwinds

*The constraint on China's growth trajectory.*

## Demographic Reality

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Working-age population | Declining |
| Median age | Rising rapidly |
| Birth rate | Far below replacement |
| Dependency ratio | Worsening |

China faces the most severe demographic decline of any major economy.

## Comparison

| Country | Demographic Outlook |
|---------|---------------------|
| United States | Immigration provides growth |
| China | Declining, no immigration |
| Japan | Declining, managed |
| India | Still growing |

## Economic Effect

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Labour supply | Shrinking |
| Consumption growth | Constrained |
| Care burden | Increasing |
| Fiscal pressure | Social support costs |

## AI as Demographic Offset

China's aggressive AI adoption is partly demographic necessity:

| Challenge | AI Response |
|-----------|-------------|
| Labour shortage | Automation |
| Care burden | Service automation |
| Productivity decline | AI productivity gains |

The Party may view AI automation as essential to maintain economic output despite shrinking workforce.

## Headwind vs. Offset

AI may partially compensate for demographic decline:
- If AI productivity gains exceed workforce shrinkage: Growth possible
- If demographic decline outpaces AI gains: Stagnation

The race between automation and demographic decline is a central uncertainty.
