# China Outlook: 2026-2036

> **Classification**: Winner
> **GDP Projection**: +4 to +6% annually
> **Confidence**: Moderate

## Core Assessment

China will pursue aggressive AI adoption regardless of social cost, backed by state capacity to suppress dissent and direct economic restructuring. This positions China as a winner in the AI transition despite significant headwinds.

## Why Winner Status

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Data centre capacity | ~32 GW; major power |
| Cultural adoption | Highest globally |
| State capacity | Can direct deployment |
| Social cost tolerance | Higher than democracies |
| Investment commitment | State-backed |

## Predictions by Period

### Near Term (2026-2028)

| Prediction | Criterion | Confidence |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Aggressive AI deployment | Adoption exceeds 70% of enterprises | High |
| Chip workarounds | Domestic alternatives achieve competitive function | Moderate |
| Manufacturing automation | Robotics deployment accelerates | High |
| Western decoupling continues | Tech trade restrictions expand | High |

### Mid Term (2029-2032)

| Prediction | Criterion | Confidence |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| AI productivity gains | GDP per worker increases 15%+ | Moderate |
| Demographic pressure visible | Working-age population decline accelerates | High |
| State control expands | AI-enabled surveillance deepens | High |
| Tech independence | Reduced dependence on Western components | Moderate |

### Late Term (2033-2036)

| Prediction | Criterion | Confidence |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Automation vs. demographics | Race outcome determines growth | Uncertain |
| Global AI power | Competitive with US despite chip gap | Moderate |
| Social stability | Maintained through control | Moderate |
| Economic position | Remains major power | High |

## Primary Risk: Taiwan

| Scenario | Probability | Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Status quo continues | Moderate | Baseline |
| Successful annexation | Low | Major gain for China |
| Failed military action | Low | Catastrophic for China |
| Blockade/gray zone | Moderate | Global disruption |

Taiwan represents the wildcard that could transform China's trajectory—in either direction.

## Secondary Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Chip restriction effectiveness | Moderate | Moderate constraint |
| Demographic acceleration | Moderate | Growth constraint |
| Social stability breakdown | Low | Transformation |
| Property sector crisis | Moderate | Near-term disruption |

## US Comparison

| Dimension | US | China |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| AI model leadership | Ahead | Behind but capable |
| Adoption speed | Slower | Faster |
| Data centre capacity | 53.7 GW | 32 GW |
| Cultural disposition | Mixed | Pro-adoption |
| State capacity for AI | Lower | Higher |

China is not ahead of the US but is a competitive major power in AI.
