# Actionable Implications

*Strategic considerations for those with China exposure.*

## For Businesses

### Operating in China

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Market access | Conditional on state relationships |
| Technology transfer | Pressure continues |
| Regulatory environment | Uncertain, state-directed |
| Competitive dynamics | Aggressive domestic competitors |

### Strategic Choices

| Option | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Full engagement | Market access but risk exposure |
| Limited presence | Reduced risk, reduced opportunity |
| Exit | Foregoes world's second-largest market |
| Diversification | China plus alternatives |

### Decoupling Preparation

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Dual supply chains | Resilience against decoupling |
| Alternative markets | Reduce China dependence |
| Technology isolation | Protect IP |
| Political risk insurance | Hedge expropriation risk |

## For Investors

### China Exposure

| Asset Class | Assessment |
|-------------|------------|
| Chinese equities | High risk, high variance |
| Chinese bonds | Government-backed but currency risk |
| Real estate | Crisis-dependent |
| State-connected | Better positioned but political risk |

### Risk Factors

| Risk | Investment Implication |
|------|------------------------|
| Taiwan conflict | Catastrophic downside |
| Decoupling acceleration | Trade and investment disruption |
| Property sector | Concentrated exposure dangerous |
| Currency | RMB may face pressure |

### Positioning

| Stance | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Underweight | Geopolitical risk premium |
| Selective | State-favoured sectors |
| Hedged | Options for Taiwan scenarios |

## Geopolitical Considerations

### Taiwan Scenarios

| Scenario | Effect | Probability |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Status quo | Baseline | Moderate |
| Successful annexation | China strengthens | Low |
| Failed military action | China weakens | Low |
| Extended confrontation | Disruption | Moderate |

### For Decision-Making

Taiwan risk creates:
- Uncertainty premium on all China exposure
- Need for contingency planning
- Value in non-China alternatives
- Timeline uncertainty

## For Individuals

### Working in China

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Career opportunities | Exist but concentrated |
| Political risk | Increasing |
| Exit flexibility | Maintain options |
| Compensation premium | May be warranted |

### General Guidance

- China remains a major economy
- State direction creates winners and losers
- Taiwan risk is genuine, not theoretical
- Hedged exposure appropriate; concentrated exposure dangerous
