# China Data Center Capacity

*Substantial infrastructure for AI development.*

## Capacity Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current capacity (2025) | ~32 GW |
| Projected (2030) | 50+ GW |
| Global share | ~25% |
| Assessment | **Major Power** |

China possesses approximately 32 gigawatts of installed data centre capacity—second only to the United States globally.

## Comparison

| Country | 2025 Capacity | 2030 Projection |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| United States | 53.7 GW | 132 GW |
| China | ~32 GW | 50+ GW |
| EU (total) | 11.9 GW | ~35 GW |

## Distribution

Major hubs:
- Beijing region
- Shanghai region
- Shenzhen/Greater Bay Area
- Tier 2 cities expanding

## Energy Access

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Total generation | Adequate |
| Coal dependence | High |
| Renewable expansion | Aggressive |
| Grid reliability | Generally high |

China can power its AI infrastructure, though environmental costs are significant.

## US Comparison Context

Despite substantial capacity, China operates at roughly 60% of US levels:
- US infrastructure advantage persists
- China expanding aggressively
- Chip restrictions create constraints on high-end compute
