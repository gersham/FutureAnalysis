## December 2025 Reality

China's AI positioning is quantified:

| Metric | China | US | Gap |
|--------|-------|-----|-----|
| Data centre capacity | 31.9 GW | 53.7 GW | 0.6x |
| Private AI investment 2024 | $9.3B | $109.1B | 0.08x |
| Notable AI models 2024 | 15 | 40 | 0.4x |
| Employees using AI at work | **93%** | ~17% embrace | **5.5x** |
| Citizen optimism ("benefits > risks") | **83%** | 39% | **2.1x** |

**Critical caveat**: Up to **80% of China's recently added data centre capacity sits idle**, suggesting execution challenges beneath the headline numbers.

**State response**: $138 billion AI/quantum fund announced March 2025. BYD targeting **20,000 humanoid robots by 2026**.

China will pursue aggressive AI adoption regardless of social cost, backed by state capacity to suppress dissent and direct economic restructuring. This positioning makes China a winner in the AI transition—second only to the United States—though genuine headwinds and one catastrophic risk cloud the trajectory.

The [cultural adoption](data/cultural-adoption.md) advantage is documented and substantial. KPMG's 2025 global study found **93% of Chinese employees use AI at work**—versus 58% globally. Chinese citizens are approximately **2-3x as optimistic** about AI's benefits as Americans (83% vs 39%). The Edelman Trust Barometer shows 54% of Chinese "embrace AI" versus only 17% of Americans—a **3x gap**. This enthusiasm reflects recent experience: China experienced the most dramatic economic transformation in modern history, powered by successive waves of technology adoption. Each wave delivered visible benefits to ordinary citizens, building a cultural reservoir of technological optimism.

The [data centre capacity](data/data-center-capacity.md) required to compete in AI exists at scale. China possesses **31.9 gigawatts** of installed capacity—roughly 60 percent of US levels but far exceeding any European nation—with aggressive expansion toward 50 gigawatts or more by 2030. However, **up to 80% of recently added capacity sits idle**, suggesting either overcapacity, execution challenges, or demand that hasn't materialised. China can power its AI infrastructure, though chip restrictions create constraints on high-end compute. The infrastructure gap with the United States is real and may be widening: US 2030 projections reach 132 GW versus China's 50+ GW.

The [state-directed deployment](trends/state-directed-deployment.md) capacity provides options unavailable to democratic competitors. The Party can direct resources to priority areas, suppress dissent to absorb displacement without political cost, accept short-term pain for strategic gain, access data without privacy constraints, and protect and promote national champions through industrial policy. This is not a value judgment but a structural observation: authoritarianism provides certain competitive advantages in technology transition. Where democratic governments face electoral consequences for AI-driven unemployment, China can mandate adoption and manage the social costs through repression if necessary.

The [demographic headwinds](trends/demographic-headwinds.md) represent the genuine constraint on China's trajectory. China faces the most severe demographic decline of any major economy: working-age population declining, median age rising rapidly, birth rate far below replacement, dependency ratio worsening. Unlike the United States, China cannot offset demographic decline through immigration. The Party may view aggressive AI automation as essential to maintain economic output despite a shrinking workforce—a race between automation and demographic decline that determines whether China achieves growth or stagnation.

The [outlook](analysis/outlook.md) projects continued aggressive AI deployment in the near term, with adoption exceeding 70 percent of major enterprises and domestic chip alternatives achieving competitive function despite US restrictions. The mid term sees demographic impact becoming visible as workforce shrinkage affects growth trajectory, with AI partially compensating but not fully offsetting the demographic headwind. By the late term, substantial automation across sectors positions China as a major AI power alongside the United States, though per capita growth may outpace total GDP growth as population declines.

The Taiwan risk represents the critical discontinuity that could invalidate all projections. The base case assumes status quo continues: economic trajectory intact, competition with the US remaining below kinetic threshold, gradual pressure on Taiwan. But military conflict over Taiwan—whether successful annexation, failed military action, or extended confrontation—would completely disrupt China's trajectory through sanctions, supply chain destruction, and potential military losses. The probability is low but non-trivial; the impact if it occurs is catastrophic; the timeline risk is higher in the 2027-2028 window.

For those with China exposure, the [implications](analysis/actionable-implications.md) require balancing structural tailwinds against geopolitical risk. China is positioned as an AI winner alongside the United States; state direction creates winners and losers but the overall trajectory is positive. Yet Taiwan risk is genuine, not theoretical, and supply chain exposure to Taiwan is systemic risk for any China-dependent operation. Hedged exposure is appropriate; concentrated exposure is dangerous. The analytical conclusion is to assume China remains a major AI power while planning for US-China competition intensifying and maintaining contingency plans for Taiwan scenarios.
