# South America: 2026-2036

*Synthesis of: [Brazil](brazil/) | [Argentina](argentina/) | [Venezuela](venezuela/)*

## December 2025 Reality

South America presents a tale of three trajectories:

| Country | GDP Growth 2025 | AI Adoption | Outlook |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Brazil** | 2.1-2.2% | 40% AI adoption; 90%+ niobium monopoly | Survivor |
| **Argentina** | 4.4-6.4% | Emerging | Restructuring |
| **Venezuela** | 0.5% to -4% | Near zero | Collapsing |

**Milei's Argentina** has achieved what seemed impossible: inflation from 211% to 1.5% monthly, first fiscal surplus in 14 years, 7.7% GDP surge in April 2025. Whether this is sustainable transformation or temporary stabilization remains contested.

South America demonstrates three distinct responses to the AI transition and global economic restructuring. Brazil, the regional giant, follows a moderate path—significant potential dampened by bureaucratic inertia and commodity dependency. Argentina, under radical free-market reform, is attempting a shock transformation that may either unlock decades of stagnation or collapse under social pressure. Venezuela continues its catastrophic decline, now a cautionary tale of petrostate failure.

[Brazil](brazil/) possesses scale advantages no other Latin American economy can match: 215 million people, the world's largest digital economy in Latin America, and 9 million companies already using AI. The government's R$23 billion AI investment plan and IMF projections of 5-8% GDP boost from AI adoption suggest significant upside. However, Brazil's growth remains constrained by structural factors—2.1% GDP growth in 2025 reflects chronic underperformance relative to potential. The question is whether Brazil's bureaucratic culture can adapt quickly enough to capture AI gains before more agile competitors.

[Argentina](argentina/) is the region's most dramatic story. President Milei's shock therapy has produced results conventional economics said were impossible: inflation collapse from 211% annually to 1.5% monthly, fiscal surplus of 1.8% of GDP after a 4% deficit, and GDP growth of 6.4% while the US grows at 3%. The October 2025 midterms validated this approach politically. However, 91% of households carry debt, and Argentina remains one of Latin America's most expensive countries. The Milei experiment will either prove that radical liberalization can unlock trapped economies or demonstrate the limits of austerity in democracies.

[Venezuela](venezuela/) is collapsing. Once Latin America's richest economy, Venezuela has lost 75% of GDP since 2014. Inflation projected at 548% in 2025, minimum wage at $1.10 monthly covering 5.6% of basic needs, 8 million people (25% of population) have fled. The reimposition of US oil sanctions in May 2025 forces Venezuela to sell at steep discounts to informal Asian markets. This is not recession—it is state failure compounded over two decades.

## Regional Dynamics

**The Resource Dividend**: South America's commodity position creates a second-order benefit from AI adoption elsewhere. As AI-accelerated economies grow, they consume more of what South America exports. Brazil controls 90%+ of global niobium production (critical for superconducting materials and advanced alloys) and is the world's second-largest iron ore producer. Argentina's lithium triangle resources become more valuable as battery demand scales. The "resources for compute" dynamic means South America benefits from global AI adoption even if domestic AI capture is limited. The question is whether resource revenues translate into compute access and broader productivity gains, or remain extractive income that fails to transform the domestic economy.

**Migration Flows**: Venezuelan exodus continues to destabilize neighbors. 8 million migrants strain Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil. Argentina's reforms may attract return migration of skilled workers who fled previous instability.

**China vs US Influence**: Brazil maintains significant Chinese investment relationships; Argentina under Milei pivots decisively toward the US ($20B IMF program, $40B US financial support). The region is fragmenting along great power lines.
