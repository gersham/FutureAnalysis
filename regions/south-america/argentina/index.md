## December 2025 Reality

Argentina under Milei has achieved what conventional economics said was impossible:

| Metric | Before Milei | December 2025 |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Monthly inflation** | ~25% | **1.5%** |
| **Annual inflation** | 211.4% | ~43% (falling) |
| **Fiscal balance** | -4% GDP deficit | **+1.8% surplus** |
| **GDP growth** | Near zero | **6.4%** (April: 7.7%) |
| **Trade balance** | Deficit | $18.9B surplus (2024 record) |

**Political validation**: October 2025 midterms—La Libertad Avanza secured 41% of vote, doubled congressional representation.

**Financial backing**: $20B IMF program + $40B US financial support commitment.

Argentina is the most dramatic economic story of the forecast period—and the most uncertain. President Javier Milei's radical free-market shock therapy has produced results that defied predictions: inflation collapse from 211% to 1.5% monthly, first fiscal surplus in 14 years, and GDP growth double the US rate. Yet the experiment remains in its early phase, the social costs are severe, and sustainability is unproven.

The inflation achievement is extraordinary. Without price controls—through pure monetary discipline and fiscal contraction—Milei reduced monthly inflation from ~25% to 1.5% in eighteen months. Annual inflation dropped from 211% to ~43% and continues falling toward projected 18-23% by year-end, with single digits targeted by 2027. This contradicts decades of Argentine economic history where inflation proved immune to orthodox remedies.

The fiscal reversal is equally remarkable. Argentina achieved its first budget surplus since 2010—1.8% of GDP—after running a 4%+ deficit. This was accomplished through drastic spending cuts: subsidy elimination, public sector downsizing, and austerity that would trigger political collapse in most democracies. The October 2025 midterms validated this approach: voters rewarded austerity rather than punishing it.

**Critical uncertainties**:
- **Social sustainability**: 91% of households carry debt; Argentina remains one of Latin America's most expensive countries
- **Investment materialization**: Can fiscal stabilization translate to productive investment?
- **Currency regime**: Peso management remains precarious
- **External shocks**: Argentina's commodity dependency means vulnerability to price swings
- **Political durability**: Can reform survive beyond Milei's term?

**The bulls' case**: Milei has broken Argentina's inflationary psychology. Foreign capital will flood in as credibility establishes. Consensus projects 3%+ annual growth through 2030—unprecedented for Argentina in recent decades. Structural reforms (labor, tax) will unlock productivity. Argentina becomes Latin America's Chile-style success story.

**The bears' case**: Austerity works temporarily but social costs accumulate. 91% household debt reflects consumption collapse, not sustainable stabilization. Poverty reduction (52.9% → 38.1%) reversed crisis-level increase, not achieved prosperity. First recession or external shock restores inflationary dynamics. Argentina has seen temporary stabilizations before—they always collapse.

**Near term (2026-2028)**: Reform momentum continues if Milei maintains political support. Currency controls gradually dismantled. Investment begins flowing to energy (Vaca Muerta), agriculture, and mining.

**Mid term (2029-2032)**: Decisive period. Either: (1) Reforms prove durable, investment accumulates, Argentina escapes century-long stagnation cycle; or (2) Social pressures, external shocks, or political change reverses trajectory.

**Late term (2033-2036)**: Outcome visibility. Success: Argentina at 3-4% sustained growth with stable inflation—transformation validated. Failure: Return to historical pattern of boom-bust cycles.

**Classification as "Restructuring"**: Argentina is neither clearly winning nor surviving but transforming—the outcome genuinely uncertain. High variance; could emerge as Winner or collapse back to Declining.
