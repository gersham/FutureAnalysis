## December 2025 Reality

Venezuela's collapse has no peacetime parallel in modern history:

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **GDP loss since 2014** | 75% |
| **Inflation 2025** | 548.6% (IMF) |
| **Inflation 2026 projected** | 628.8% |
| **Minimum wage (monthly)** | $1.10 |
| **Basic basket cost** | $710 |
| **Wages vs needs** | Minimum wage covers **5.6%** of basic needs |
| **Population exodus** | 8 million (25% of population) |

**Context**: This is the worst economic crisis in Venezuelan history and among the worst peacetime collapses since the mid-20th century.

Venezuela is not declining—it is collapsing. What was once Latin America's richest economy has lost three-quarters of its GDP over a decade, driven 25% of its population into exile, and now faces hyperinflation that will exceed 600% in 2026. There is no plausible recovery scenario within the forecast period.

The May 2025 reimposition of US sectoral sanctions on oil exports accelerated existing collapse. Venezuela now sells oil to informal Asian markets at steep discounts, further reducing already-depleted revenues. Oil production, while recovering to 2019 levels (~1 million barrels/day), cannot compensate for pricing pressure and market restrictions.

The human catastrophe exceeds the economic statistics. A minimum wage of $1.10 monthly covers 5.6% of basic needs. A family requires 18 minimum wages to cover essentials. Eight million Venezuelans—one quarter of the population—have fled, creating the Western Hemisphere's largest displacement crisis. Those remaining face not gradual impoverishment but economic apocalypse.

**Why recovery is impossible within the forecast period**:
- **Oil infrastructure degradation**: Decades of underinvestment have damaged production capacity
- **Human capital flight**: Skilled workers and professionals have emigrated en masse
- **Institutional collapse**: Functioning institutions no longer exist in most sectors
- **Sanctions regime**: Unlikely to ease under current political conditions
- **Debt overhang**: Defaulted obligations exceed $150 billion
- **Political deadlock**: Neither regime change nor accommodation appears plausible

**Comparison**: Venezuela's collapse exceeds the Great Depression in severity and duration. It approaches Syrian civil war economic impact—but without active warfare as the primary cause.

**Near term (2026-2028)**: Continued deterioration. Inflation remains triple-digit or higher. Migration continues. Oil sector stagnates at sub-optimal production. No political resolution emerges.

**Mid term (2029-2032)**: Further degradation approaches floor. At some point economies reach subsistence baseline—Venezuela approaches this limit. Those who could leave have largely left.

**Late term (2033-2036)**: Two scenarios: (1) Political change enables reintegration—unlikely but not impossible; requires both regime change and sustained international support; (2) Continued stagnation at collapsed baseline—most probable.

**For individuals**: Venezuela offers nothing within the forecast period. Those with ability to emigrate should. Those remaining face continued impoverishment under conditions that have no domestic solution.

**Regional implications**: Venezuelan migration strains Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, and beyond. Eight million displaced persons reshape regional labor markets and politics. Venezuela's collapse is not contained within its borders.
