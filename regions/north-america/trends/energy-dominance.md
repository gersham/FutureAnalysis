# Energy Dominance

*The structural advantage of the North American energy shield.*

## The Price Gap

While Europe faces a permanent energy crisis and Asia relies on vulnerable seaborne imports, North America is energy independent and structurally cheap.

*   **Natural Gas:** The US is the world's largest producer. Henry Hub prices are consistently 50-70% lower than European TTF or Asian JKM benchmarks.
*   **Electricity:** Industrial electricity rates in the US South and Midwest are ~50% of German rates and competitive with China.

## The Manufacturing Magnet

Energy-intensive industries are migrating to the US:
*   **Ammonia/Fertilizer:** Moving from Europe to the US Gulf Coast.
*   **Steel/Aluminum:** Recycled steel (Electric Arc Furnaces) driven by cheap US electricity.
*   **Data Centers:** The AI boom requires massive power. The US is one of the few developed nations with the primary energy reserves to power 100GW+ of new demand, though grid transmission remains a bottleneck.

## Trajectory (2026-2030)

*   **2026:** US becomes the undisputed top LNG exporter, setting the price for global energy.
*   **2028:** "Energy Protectionism" emerges. Political pressure builds to limit LNG exports to keep domestic prices low for AI/Industry, creating tension with European allies.

## Falsifiable Criteria
- **Price Spread:** The spread between US Henry Hub gas and European TTF gas remains >$5/MMBtu on average through 2028.
- **Industrial CapEx:** >$50B in foreign direct investment (FDI) into US heavy industry (chemicals, metals) from European/Asian firms between 2025-2028.
