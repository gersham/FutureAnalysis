# Continental Integration

*The emergence of "Fortress North America".*

## The Strategic Logic

As global trade fractures, North America is re-integrating into a self-sufficient industrial bloc. The USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement) is no longer just a trade deal; it is a strategic perimeter.

### The Division of Labor
*   **United States:** Capital, R&D, AI software, high-end semiconductor design, energy export.
*   **Canada:** Strategic resources (uranium, potash, critical minerals), hydro-power for compute, fresh water.
*   **Mexico:** Manufacturing base, low-cost labor pool, demographic stabilizer.

## The Decoupling Engine

The US cannot decouple from China alone. It requires Mexico to replace the Chinese manufacturing base.
*   **Auto:** Integrated North American supply chain is already displacing Asian imports.
*   **Electronics:** Foxconn and others are moving assembly to Chihuahua and Jalisco to serve the US market.

## Friction Points
*   **Mexican Institutional Risk:** The potential "cartelization" of the Mexican state poses the single biggest threat to this integration. If security costs in Mexico exceed the tariff savings, the model breaks.
*   **Canadian Regulatory Drift:** If Canada aligns too closely with EU-style AI regulation, it creates a "compliance border" within the bloc.

## Falsifiable Criteria
- **Trade Volume:** Intra-North American trade exceeds trade with Asia by >25% by 2028.
- **Supply Chain:** Mexico surpasses China as the top source of US imports for 3 consecutive years (2025-2027).
