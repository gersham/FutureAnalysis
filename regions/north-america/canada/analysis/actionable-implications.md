# Actionable Implications: Canada

*What to do based on Canada's trajectory.*

## For Residents

### Career Positioning

| Current Situation | Recommendation |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Services sector in Toronto/Vancouver | Develop exit options; skills portable elsewhere |
| Resource sector | Structural tailwinds; consider staying |
| Public sector | Faces fiscal constraints; diversify skills |
| Tech (non-AI) | Moderate pressure; consider US opportunities |

### Geographic Considerations

| Location | Outlook |
|----------|---------|
| Toronto | Services displacement; high cost; declining relative advantage |
| Vancouver | Similar to Toronto; tech/services exposed |
| Calgary/Edmonton | Energy sector may provide alternative |
| Resource regions | Potential beneficiaries; infrastructure investment |

### Ownership vs Renting

In the state-capital model, citizens increasingly interact with infrastructure as **payers**:
- Housing: institutional landlords favoured by policy
- Utilities: long-term contracts to infrastructure owners
- Consider ownership where possible before institutional capture accelerates

## For Investors

### Favoured Exposures

| Sector | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Canadian resource companies | Structural tailwinds from infrastructure buildout |
| Energy infrastructure | Policy support, long-term contracts |
| Critical minerals | Global AI demand + domestic policy support |

### Cautious Exposures

| Sector | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Toronto commercial real estate | Services sector contraction pressure |
| Canadian financial services | AI displacement + concentrated economy |
| Retail/consumer discretionary | Depends on distribution of gains |

### Structural Plays

- Canadian pension funds will own infrastructure; consider their public vehicles
- Watch for infrastructure trusts/REITs as model matures

## For Business

### Opportunities

| Opportunity | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| Resource services | Supporting infrastructure buildout |
| Energy services | LNG, SMR, transmission projects |
| Northern logistics | As transmission and infrastructure extend north |

### Risks

| Risk | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Regulatory uncertainty | Model may face political challenge |
| Labour market tightness | Resource regions compete for workers |
| Services contraction | B2B services to financial sector face pressure |

## Key Dates and Triggers

| Date/Event | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| First LNG exports | Model validation |
| 2025-2026 federal budget | Signals on institutional ownership terms |
| Next federal election | Political verdict on model |
| Services employment data | Leading indicator of displacement |
