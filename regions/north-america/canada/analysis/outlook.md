# Canada Outlook: 2026-2036

> **Classification**: Restructured
> **Growth Outlook**: Moderate (uneven/concentrated)
> **Confidence**: Moderate

## Core Assessment

Canada defies simple categorisation. Resources will be developed; the question is **who captures the gains**. The combination of resource advantages and state-capital fusion model produces growth, but distribution of that growth is the critical variable.

## Scenarios

### Optimistic Case (Broadly shared growth)

- Infrastructure built that Canada failed to build for decades
- Indigenous communities gain equity stakes and revenue streams
- National productivity rises
- Services job losses offset by resource economy growth
- Political bargain seen as acceptable

**Criteria for confirmation:**
- Indigenous equity participation exceeds $10B
- Net employment positive outside major services cities
- Median income grows with GDP

### Base Case (+3% GDP, concentrated)

- Infrastructure built
- Institutional investors capture primary returns
- Services contraction not fully offset
- Regional inequality widens
- Political acceptance unclear

### Pessimistic Case (+2% GDP, highly concentrated)

- Public pays for de-risking
- Institutional investors capture long-term ownership and fee streams
- Citizens become payers (ratepayers, renters, toll-payers)
- State becomes risk manager for others' assets
- Structural conflicts emerge

**Criteria for confirmation:**
- Institutional ownership of new infrastructure exceeds 70%
- Rental share of housing increases 10+ percentage points
- Utilities costs rise faster than inflation
