# Services Sector Displacement

*AI automation pressure on Toronto and Vancouver professional services.*

## Overview

Canada's services economy—concentrated in Toronto and Vancouver—faces the same AI displacement pressures as any developed nation. Financial services, professional consultancy, administrative functions, and knowledge work are all exposed.

## Affected Sectors

| Sector | Exposure | Location |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Financial services | High | Toronto (Bay Street) |
| Legal services | High | Toronto, Vancouver |
| Accounting/consulting | High | Major cities |
| Tech services | Moderate-High | Toronto, Vancouver, Waterloo |
| Administrative | High | All major centres |

## Timeline

Follows global AI displacement wave:

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 2026-2028 | Displacement becomes visible; hiring freezes, layoffs begin |
| 2029-2032 | Structural contraction; employment down 15-25% |
| 2033-2036 | New equilibrium; services sector significantly smaller |

## Interaction with Resource Economy

The critical question for Canada: does resource economy growth offset services decline?

| Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Resource boom + services decline | Net positive nationally; regional winners/losers |
| Resource moderate + services decline | Restructuring with uneven gains |
| Both decline | Genuine economic contraction |

## Geographic Implications

- **Toronto/Vancouver**: Face displacement without resource economy offset
- **Calgary/Edmonton**: Energy sector may provide alternative
- **Resource regions**: Potential beneficiaries of infrastructure buildout
