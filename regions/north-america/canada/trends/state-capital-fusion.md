# State-Capital Fusion Model

*The restructuring of the Canadian federal state as an investment platform.*

## Overview

Under current policy direction, the federal state is being refitted into an **investment platform**—a machine whose primary function is removing risk from large projects so that global and domestic institutional capital can own the resulting assets.

## Mechanism

The architecture is explicit:

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Building Canada Act** | Cabinet designates "projects of national interest"; authorises via single instrument |
| **Effect** | Aggregates or disapplies normal permitting under environmental and regulatory frameworks |
| **Major Projects Office** | Coordinates project pipeline; Calgary-based |
| **Canada Growth Fund** | Backstops carbon-price risk via long-term offtake |

## The De-Risking Logic

For each major project type:

1. **State provides**: Legal certainty, tax expenditures, guarantees, regulatory streamlining, upfront capital
2. **Private capital provides**: Long-term ownership, operational expertise, fee capture
3. **Result**: Risk socialised, returns privatised (critics) OR infrastructure finally built (supporters)

## Foreign Capital Dimension

The model explicitly welcomes foreign institutional investment:

- UAE agreement shields $50B under ISDS protection
- 15-year survival clauses lock in protections
- Canadian pension funds positioned alongside Gulf sovereigns
- Explicit goal: long-term institutional ownership of Canadian infrastructure

## Timeline

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 2025 | Framework established; Major Projects Office launched |
| 2026-2028 | First tranche projects advance; LNG, SMRs, mining |
| 2029-2032 | Returns begin flowing to institutional owners |
| 2033+ | Model matures; ownership structure entrenched |

## Implications

### Optimistic View
- Infrastructure finally built after decades of failure
- Indigenous communities gain equity and revenue
- Productivity rises
- Canada captures resource advantage

### Pessimistic View
- Public pays, institutions capture returns
- Citizens become ratepayers/renters/toll-payers
- State becomes risk manager for others' assets
- Structural conflicts of interest institutionalised
