## December 2025 Reality

Mexico presents a study in contradictions—record FDI alongside near-zero GDP growth:

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **GDP growth 2025** | 0.3-0.4% (Banxico revised down from 0.6%) |
| **Q3 2025 GDP** | -0.3% (quarter-on-quarter contraction) |
| **FDI Jan-Sep 2025** | **$40.9 billion** (record high, +14.5% YoY) |
| **Q1 2025 FDI** | $21.37 billion (highest Q1 ever) |
| **Manufacturing share of FDI** | 43.2% |
| **AI market 2025** | $450 million (359% YoY growth) |

**The paradox**: Record foreign investment coexists with economic stagnation. Nearshoring capital flows in; GDP barely moves.

## The Fortress America Effect

Mexico's most important structural advantage is simple: it borders the AI goliath.

The United States will capture AI gains at a scale no other nation can match. Mexico benefits from this explosion by proximity and integration—not as dramatically as Canada, but meaningfully:

- **Manufacturing integration**: US AI-era manufacturing needs components and assembly; Mexico provides both
- **Economic linkage**: 80%+ of Mexican exports go to the US; American growth pulls Mexico along
- **Investment spillover**: North American supply chain investment includes Mexico almost by default
- **Infrastructure adjacency**: Texas data centres create demand for Mexican power and components

The Fortress America effect does not make Mexico a winner—too many domestic constraints for that. But it provides a floor that prevents decline even with mediocre execution. Being adjacent to the engine of AI growth provides tailwinds regardless of Mexican policy choices.

## The Nearshoring Thesis

Mexico was positioned as the primary beneficiary of supply chain diversification away from China. The thesis was compelling: USMCA access to US markets, geographic proximity, competitive labour costs, existing manufacturing infrastructure, and deep structural integration with US industry. Morgan Stanley projected nearshoring could add $46 billion in new investment and boost annual GDP growth to 3%.

**The reality is more modest.** The World Bank notes that multinational companies relocated to Mexico amid nearshoring generate only around 0.2% of GDP. FDI flows to specific sectors (automotive, electronics, aerospace) without transforming the broader economy. The benefits concentrate geographically in northern and central states—Nuevo León, Baja California, Chihuahua, the Bajío region—while much of Mexico sees little impact.

The nearshoring opportunity is real but narrower than anticipated—though the Fortress America effect provides baseline support even if nearshoring disappoints.

## The Tariff Sword

US trade policy represents the critical uncertainty. Mexico's economy depends heavily on its commercial relationship with the United States—its top trading partner by a wide margin.

**2025 tariff timeline:**
- February 1: Trump signs executive orders for 25% tariffs on Mexico
- March 4: Tariffs take effect after 30-day suspension
- March 5-6: Auto imports and USMCA-covered goods exempted
- July 12: Reciprocal tariffs announced to increase to 30%
- October 28: Tariff increase paused indefinitely

**Current state**: Over 84% of Mexico-US trade remains tariff-free due to USMCA exemptions. But the exemptions are discretionary, not guaranteed.

**Economic impact of full tariffs**: A 25% tariff on all goods would reduce Mexico's GDP by approximately 2% relative to baseline—devastating for an economy already growing at 0.3%.

The steel industry illustrates the vulnerability. US tariffs on steel (initially 25%, doubled to 50% in June) forced Mexican producers to halt production for months. "It affected us greatly," one Nuevo León manufacturer reported. "Many companies decided to halt production, and our services were no longer needed."

Mexico's trajectory depends substantially on decisions made in Washington, not Mexico City.

## The Security Constraint

Cartel violence imposes a ceiling on Mexican development that economic policy alone cannot lift.

**Scale of the problem:**
- Since 2007, organised crime-related homicides increased sixfold—from ~3,000 to ~18,000 in 2024
- Over 300,000 homicides in the last decade
- Mexico's largest cartel imposes annual economic burden exceeding $19 billion
- 78% of Mexican voters believe the security situation presents unacceptable risks

**Geographic concentration**: Violence clusters in specific states—Colima, Guanajuato, Morelos, Baja California, Quintana Roo—but the security premium affects investment decisions nationwide. Foreign investors evaluate not just current violence but the risk of escalation.

**The cartel-FDI dynamic**: Nearshoring investment concentrates in relatively secure northern states. But cargo hijackings, extortion, and territorial disputes deter investment in regions that could otherwise benefit. The security map and the investment map increasingly overlap—both concentrated in the same limited geography.

The 2025 US designation of Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organisations adds diplomatic complexity without obviously improving security outcomes.

## AI and Technology

Mexico shows rapid AI adoption growth but from a low base:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AI market 2025 | $450 million |
| AI market 2030 projected | $12.5 billion |
| YoY growth | 359% (vs 210% Brazil, 185% Colombia) |
| Companies using AI | 2 million+ (38% penetration, up from 29%) |
| Advanced AI implementation | Only 3% of companies |

**Microsoft's $1.3 billion investment** (announced September 2024) aims to enhance cloud computing and AI infrastructure. Nearly 70% of Mexican enterprises plan to increase AI spending in 2025.

**Constraints**: Talent deficit (56% cite lack of talent as main barrier), weak data governance (less than 30% have defined processes), and no AI-specific legislation. Salesforce's Global AI Readiness Index places Mexico at 15.3/100, below global average of 22.1.

Mexico is adopting AI faster than Latin American peers but remains far behind global leaders. The question is whether AI amplifies manufacturing competitiveness or whether talent and infrastructure gaps limit impact.

## Outlook Assessment

### Near Term (2026-2028)

- GDP growth recovers modestly to 1-2% range (Banxico projects 1.1% for 2026, 2% for 2027)
- Nearshoring FDI continues but benefits remain geographically concentrated
- Tariff uncertainty persists; USMCA exemptions provide protection but not certainty
- Security situation continues as structural constraint
- AI adoption accelerates in manufacturing and finance sectors

### Mid Term (2029-2032)

Determining factors emerge:
- **USMCA review** (2026): Outcome shapes trade relationship for following decade
- **US political trajectory**: Protectionist or open trade orientation
- **Security evolution**: Improvement, stagnation, or deterioration
- **Nearshoring execution**: Does investment translate to broader productivity gains?

### Late Term (2033-2036)

Two scenarios:

**Optimistic**: Mexico emerges as North American manufacturing hub. Nearshoring benefits diffuse beyond northern states. Security improves sufficiently to unlock investment in new regions. USMCA provides stable market access. GDP growth sustains 2-3% with manufacturing upgrading toward higher value-added production.

**Pessimistic**: Tariff uncertainty or USMCA deterioration limits trade access. Security situation stagnates or worsens. Nearshoring benefits remain narrowly concentrated. GDP growth remains below 2%, insufficient for convergence with developed economies. Mexico remains trapped between its potential and its constraints.

---

## Classification Rationale

**"Contested"** because:

1. **Genuine uncertainty**: The determining factors (US trade policy, security trajectory, execution capacity) cannot be confidently forecast
2. **High variance outcomes**: Scenarios range from "North American manufacturing winner" to "trapped in low-growth stagnation"
3. **External dependencies**: Mexico's trajectory depends substantially on decisions made in Washington
4. **Structural constraints**: Security issues impose ceilings that economic policy alone cannot lift
5. **Real opportunities**: Nearshoring, USMCA access, and manufacturing base provide genuine advantages if constraints ease

Mexico is neither clearly a winner (too many constraints, too dependent on external factors) nor clearly declining (FDI record, manufacturing base, demographic youth). The outcome depends on variables with genuinely uncertain trajectories.

## Implications

### For Investors

- Nearshoring thesis valid but narrower than originally projected
- Geographic selectivity essential—northern states offer different risk/return than central/southern regions
- Tariff uncertainty creates volatility; USMCA-covered sectors provide more protection
- Manufacturing and export-oriented investments aligned with structural advantages

### For Businesses

- Supply chain diversification to Mexico reduces China risk but adds tariff uncertainty
- Site selection should weight security alongside traditional factors
- USMCA compliance increasingly important for tariff protection
- AI adoption in manufacturing operations can enhance competitiveness

### For Individuals

- Economic opportunity concentrates geographically—location within Mexico matters enormously
- Manufacturing and export sectors offer more stability than domestically-oriented services
- Security considerations vary dramatically by region
- Emigration to US remains significant option; remittances continue as economic anchor
