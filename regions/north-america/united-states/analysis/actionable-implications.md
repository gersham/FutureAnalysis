# Actionable Implications: United States

*What to do based on US trajectory.*

## Core Insight

Being in the US is advantageous for the AI transition. But gains concentrate; not everyone benefits equally. Position in frontier firms/sectors matters more than geography alone.

## For Residents

### Career Positioning

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| At frontier tech firm | Capture upside; equity participation valuable |
| At non-frontier firm | Skills development for transition; AI-adjacent roles |
| Professional services | Displacement pressure; consider pivot |
| Entry-level white collar | Highest displacement risk; accelerate skill development |

### Geographic Considerations

| Location | Outlook |
|----------|---------|
| SF Bay Area | Epicentre of gains; high cost but high opportunity |
| Seattle | Major tech hub; similar dynamics |
| Austin/Texas | Growing tech presence; lower cost |
| NYC | Mixed; finance faces pressure, tech growing |
| Non-tech metros | Displacement pressure without direct access to gains |

### Wealth Implications

- Inequality will increase substantially
- Frontier firm employees capture disproportionate gains
- Asset ownership (especially equity) increasingly important
- Real estate in tech hubs likely appreciates; elsewhere uncertain

## For Investors

### Favoured Exposures

| Sector | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| US large-cap tech | Direct AI exposure |
| AI infrastructure | Data centres, energy, semiconductors |
| Energy | Powering AI buildout |

### Cautious Exposures

| Sector | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Non-frontier professional services | Displacement pressure |
| Traditional finance | AI + alternative finance disruption |
| Retail/consumer discretionary | Depends on distribution of gains |

### Geographic Allocation

- US overweight remains appropriate through transition
- Dollar assets likely maintain value
- International diversification still prudent for tail risks

## For Business

### Opportunities

| Opportunity | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| AI services/consulting | Helping non-frontier adopt |
| Infrastructure | Data centres, energy, cooling |
| AI-enabled services | Capturing productivity gains |

### Risks

| Risk | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Competing with frontier firms | Existential; adopt or lose |
| Talent competition | Frontier firms attract best |
| Regulatory uncertainty | Low but non-zero |

## Key Uncertainties

- Pace of non-frontier displacement
- Political response to inequality
- Whether social instability remains contained
- Regulatory trajectory post-2028 election
