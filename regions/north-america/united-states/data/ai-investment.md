# United States AI Investment

*Private capital flows into AI development and infrastructure.*

## 2024 Investment

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Private AI Investment | $109 billion |
| Multiple vs China | ~12x |
| Global Share | ~70% |

## Characteristics

- American firms dominate model development
- American capital finances deployment
- American data centres expand at rates dwarfing competitors
- Capital flows into AI infrastructure at multiples of any other nation

## The Frontier Adoption Dynamic

Only ~25% of American companies have meaningfully deployed AI. However, what matters for national economic outcomes is **frontier adoption**, not average adoption:

- Leading technology companies deploy AI at unprecedented scale
- These frontier firms generate disproportionate share of economic value
- Cultural wariness of middle America is economically bypassed
- Median citizen luddite tendencies are simply irrelevant
