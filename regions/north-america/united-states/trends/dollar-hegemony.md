# Dollar Hegemony

*The persistence of reserve currency status.*

## Current Status

The American financial system retains its role as global reserve currency. This status persists not because of American virtue but because there is no alternative.

## Why It Persists

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Network effects | Global trade denominated in dollars |
| Depth of markets | US Treasury market unmatched |
| Rule of law | Property rights enforced (relatively) |
| No alternative | Euro fragmented, Yuan not convertible, crypto unstable |

## Through the AI Transition

The dollar will remain king through 2036 because:

- AI transition increases US economic dominance, not diminishes it
- Technology companies generating new wealth are US-based
- Capital flows toward AI infrastructure concentrated in US
- No credible alternative currency emerges in this timeframe

## Political Instability Contained

American political instability—and there will be instability—cannot derail dollar dominance:

- Federal dysfunction does not affect underlying economic transformation
- AI boom sufficiently entrenched by 2028 that no politically plausible intervention unseats it
- Global system lacks exit option regardless of US political performance
