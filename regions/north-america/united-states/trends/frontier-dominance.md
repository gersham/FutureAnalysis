# Frontier Firm Dominance

*The concentration of AI gains in leading technology companies.*

## The American Paradox Resolved

The United States presents a paradox: the nation that creates AI is not the nation that adopts it fastest. Only about 25 percent of American companies have meaningfully deployed AI. Americans are more wary of AI than Chinese or Indian populations, particularly regarding data privacy and algorithmic decision-making.

Yet the paradox resolves in America's favour.

## Why Average Adoption Doesn't Matter

What matters for national economic outcomes is not average adoption but **frontier adoption**—the productivity of the leading firms that compete globally:

- American technology companies deploy AI at unprecedented scale
- American data centres expand at rates that dwarf competitors
- American capital flows into AI infrastructure at multiples of any other nation
- The firms that generate American wealth are AI-native

The cultural wariness of middle America toward AI is economically irrelevant when frontier firms capture the gains. The luddite tendencies of the median citizen are simply bypassed.

## Implications

### For National Outcomes
- US captures AI transition gains despite low average adoption
- Wealth concentrates in frontier firms and their employees
- Geographic concentration in tech hubs intensifies
- Inequality increases but total wealth expands

### For Non-Frontier Firms
- Face AI-enabled competition from frontier firms
- Must adopt or lose competitiveness
- Displacement pressure without capturing gains
- Employees in non-frontier firms face displacement
