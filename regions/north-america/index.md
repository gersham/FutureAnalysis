# North America: 2026-2036

*Synthesis of: [United States](united-states/) | [Canada](canada/) | [Mexico](mexico/)*

## December 2025 Reality

North America's AI infrastructure dominance is not projected—it is materialising:

| Metric | United States | Rest of World |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Data centre capacity | 53.7 GW (44% global) | 68 GW combined |
| Private AI investment 2024 | $109.1 billion | $23 billion combined |
| Stargate project | $500B committed | No equivalent announced |
| Notable AI models 2024 | 40 | 18 (China 15, EU 3) |

North America presents a study in divergence within shared continental advantages. Both nations possess energy abundance that Europe lacks—the fundamental substrate for AI infrastructure competition. Both face services sector vulnerability in their major cities. Yet the trajectories split sharply: the United States is positioned to be the dominant beneficiary of the AI transition globally, while Canada's path leads through a state-capital fusion model that may produce growth with concentrated rather than broadly shared gains.

The [United States](united-states/) controls every dimension of the AI transition. American firms created the foundational models; American capital finances their deployment; American energy resources can power the necessary data centres; American financial infrastructure retains global reserve currency status. With the largest installed and planned data centre capacity globally (see [Global Data: Data Center Capacity](../../global/data/data-center-capacity.md)), the United States generates and captures AI value at scales no competitor can match. Virginia alone hosts over 12 gigawatts.

**The Stargate Project** (announced January 2025) represents unprecedented infrastructure commitment:
- $500 billion over 4 years
- 6 sites operational or announced (Texas, New Mexico, Ohio, Wisconsin)
- 10 GW AI-dedicated capacity target by end 2025
- 100,000+ jobs projected

Political instability at the federal level cannot derail the underlying technological and economic transformation because the transformation occurs in the private sector, powered by abundant energy and financed by capital that has nowhere else to go. The services economy in New York and San Francisco will face AI displacement pressure, but American technology firms are AI‑native—the disruption they cause globally accrues to American balance sheets. The United States is the clear winner with a **high growth outlook**.

[Canada](canada/) possesses everything required for resource‑economy success: hydroelectric power, natural gas, critical minerals, arable land, fresh water. What distinguishes Canada is not what it has but how it is being deployed. Under the current federal architecture, the state is being refitted into an investment platform—a machine whose primary function is removing risk from large projects so that global and institutional capital can own the resulting assets. The Building Canada Act, the Major Projects Office, Build Canada Homes, the Canada Growth Fund, investment protection agreements with Gulf sovereigns—together they create a model where the public absorbs development risk while private institutional investors capture long‑term ownership. In the optimistic scenario, Canada finally builds infrastructure it has failed to build for decades: LNG export capacity, transmission lines, modular housing, next‑generation nuclear. In the pessimistic scenario, citizens interact with backbone infrastructure primarily as payers over decades—ratepayers for power, renters for housing, toll‑payers for ports—while institutional investors capture the ownership and fee streams. The services economy in Toronto and Vancouver will suffer AI automation like any other developed nation; the question is whether resource development compensates and for whom. Canada's trajectory is **Restructured** rather than simple growth or decline, with a **moderate (uneven/concentrated) growth outlook**.

The energy advantage both nations share separates North America from Europe. The United States leverages its energy abundance for AI infrastructure dominance at unprecedented scale. Canada uses it to attract foreign capital for resource extraction under long-term institutional ownership arrangements. Europe, by contrast, faces electricity costs three to four times American levels, making competitive AI infrastructure expansion effectively impossible. This continental energy position is structural and will compound throughout the forecast period.

The regulatory divergence risk represents the key difference in how these nations could evolve. Canada shows signs of following the European regulatory model on AI governance; the United States maintains a more permissive environment. Should Canada adopt EU-style regulation, it would forfeit advantages that geography provides—the same pattern observed across European nations. The American regulatory environment, while not laissez-faire, permits AI deployment at scales and speeds that constrained jurisdictions cannot match.

Both nations face services sector vulnerability in their major metropolitan areas. New York, San Francisco, Toronto, and Vancouver are professional services hubs that face AI displacement pressure regardless of national trajectory. The difference is what offsets this vulnerability: for the United States, technology sector dominance means the AI that displaces workers also accrues to American firms; for Canada, resource development is the offsetting factor. Neither nation escapes services automation—the question is what provides compensation and how broadly gains distribute.

[Mexico](mexico/) presents a contested case within the North American framework. The nearshoring thesis positioned Mexico as the primary beneficiary of supply chain diversification away from China—USMCA access, geographic proximity, competitive labour costs, existing manufacturing infrastructure. FDI reached record levels in 2025 ($40.9 billion in nine months, +14.5% YoY), with manufacturing capturing 43% of inflows. Yet GDP growth stagnated at 0.3-0.4%, and the economy contracted in Q3 2025. The paradox: record investment coexists with near-zero growth.

Three constraints limit Mexico's trajectory. First, **US tariff uncertainty**: while 84% of Mexico-US trade remains tariff-free under USMCA exemptions, these exemptions are discretionary. Full 25% tariffs would reduce Mexico's GDP by approximately 2%. Second, **cartel violence** imposes economic costs exceeding $19 billion annually and constrains investment geography—FDI concentrates in relatively secure northern states while much of Mexico sees limited benefit. Third, **execution capacity**: nearshoring investment flows to specific sectors without transforming the broader economy. The World Bank notes that multinational relocations generate only 0.2% of Mexico's GDP.

Mexico's outcome depends substantially on decisions made in Washington rather than Mexico City. The determining factors—US trade policy, USMCA review outcomes, security trajectory—cannot be confidently forecast. This places Mexico in the **Contested** category: genuine uncertainty with high‑variance outcomes ranging from "North American manufacturing winner" to "trapped in low‑growth stagnation." Growth outlook: **uncertain**.
