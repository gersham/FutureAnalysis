# Nearshoring Risk

*The race between investment and insecurity in Mexico.*

## The Opportunity (Data Baseline 2024-2025)

*   **FDI Surge:** Foreign Direct Investment in Mexico reached record highs in the baseline period (~$40B+ annualized), driven by "nearshoring."
*   **Manufacturing Share:** Mexico has surpassed China as the US's largest trading partner.
*   **Industrial Vacancy:** Vacancy rates in northern border industrial parks (Monterrey, Juarez) are near zero (<2%).

## The Risk (Security & Governance)

*   **Cartel Activity:** US designation of major cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) creates liability risks for multinationals.
*   **Judicial Reform:** 2024-2025 reforms to the Mexican judiciary have raised concerns about contract enforcement and rule of law.
*   **Infrastructure:** Energy and water shortages in northern Mexico are capping growth.

## Analytical Outlook

Mexico faces a binary outcome:
1.  **The Polish Path:** Successful integration into the wealthy neighbor's supply chain, leading to rapid development.
2.  **The Narco-State Trap:** Security costs and corruption strangle the golden goose; manufacturing moves to robots in the US rather than humans in Mexico.

## Falsifiable Criteria
- **FDI Reversal:** Annual FDI into Mexico falls by >20% year-over-year in any year between 2026-2028.
- **Security Designation:** The US imposes major banking sanctions on top Mexican financial institutions due to cartel money laundering risks.
