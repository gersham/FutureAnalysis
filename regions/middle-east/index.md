# Middle East: 2026-2036

*Synthesis of: [Saudi Arabia](saudi-arabia/) | [UAE](uae/) | [Israel](israel/) | [Iran](iran/)*

## December 2025 Reality

The Middle East presents the starkest divergence in trajectories of any region:

| Country | AI Investment | Data Centers | Outlook |
|---------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| **Saudi Arabia** | $100B "Project Transcendence" | 33 existing + 42 planned (2.2 GW) | Winner |
| **UAE** | $148B invested since 2024 | 35+ centers; 1 GW Stargate cluster | Winner |
| **Israel** | $3.2B Q1 2025 funding | Tech hub; 39 unicorns | Survivor (War-contingent) |
| **Iran** | Near zero | Minimal | Collapsing |

The Middle East bifurcates sharply between petrostates executing aggressive AI diversification strategies and those trapped by sanctions, ideology, or conflict. The Gulf states—Saudi Arabia and UAE—are attempting the most ambitious economic pivots in modern history: converting oil wealth into AI infrastructure before petroleum becomes obsolete. Israel maintains its technology position despite existential conflict. Iran collapses under sanctions, mismanagement, and isolation.

[Saudi Arabia](saudi-arabia/) has launched "Project Transcendence"—a $100 billion AI initiative that represents the largest non-US AI infrastructure investment globally. With $14.9 billion announced at LEAP 2025 alone, partnerships with AWS ($5B), Google ($10B), Microsoft ($2.1B), and Oracle ($1.5B), and 42 new data centers planned adding 2.2 GW of capacity, Saudi Arabia is executing Vision 2030's pivot from oil dependency with unprecedented urgency. The question is whether infrastructure can translate into capability—building data centers is easier than building AI talent.

[UAE](uae/) has invested $148 billion in AI domestically and abroad since 2024, including a $1.4 trillion 10-year investment framework with the United States targeting AI, semiconductors, and quantum computing. Abu Dhabi's Stargate project—a 1 GW AI supercomputing cluster developed with OpenAI—represents sovereign AI ambition at scale. The deal includes ChatGPT Plus subscriptions for the entire UAE population. With 4.8% GDP growth projected for 2025 and non-oil GDP at 5.3%, the diversification is already visible in the numbers.

[Israel](israel/) demonstrates extraordinary resilience—recording its strongest year ever for exits including Google's $32 billion Wiz acquisition despite ongoing war. AI accounts for nearly half of all new startups and funding. However, 8,000+ tech workers have left since October 2023, and the economy grew only 1% in 2024. Classification as "Survivor" is contingent on conflict resolution; extended war risks accelerating brain drain and eroding the innovation ecosystem.

[Iran](iran/) is collapsing. GDP growth at 0.3% (IMF), inflation at 43%+, currency at 1,000,000 rial to the dollar, and rolling 3-4 hour daily blackouts. The reimposition of maximum pressure sanctions in 2025 has crashed oil exports. Capital flight of $34 billion in 18 months signals that even Iran's elite have lost confidence. Iran's economy in 2000 exceeded UAE, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia—now all three have GDPs 3x larger. This is structural decline compounded by ideological rigidity.

## Regional Dynamics

**Gulf Cooperation**: Saudi Arabia and UAE are competing but also cooperating on AI infrastructure—both participate in global AI partnerships, both are courting the same hyperscalers, both are building sovereign capabilities. The competition may drive faster execution.

**Israel-Gulf Normalization**: The Abraham Accords created commercial relationships that survived the Gaza war. Israeli technology and Gulf capital represent a powerful combination if political conditions permit deeper integration.

**Iran Isolation**: Iran's exclusion from regional AI development widens. While neighbors build GW-scale data centers, Iran cannot keep the lights on. The gap compounds over time.
