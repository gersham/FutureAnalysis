## December 2025 Reality

Egypt's fiscal position is precarious:

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Population** | ~105 million |
| **GDP growth 2025** | 4.2% projected |
| **External debt service 2025-26** | ~$44 billion |
| **Interest-to-revenue ratio** | ~90% |
| **Interest share of spending** | 60% |
| **IMF programme** | $9.2 billion EFF (4 of 8 reviews complete) |
| **Suez Canal revenue loss** | $8 billion (Houthi attacks) |
| **Inflation** | 12.5% (down from 38% in late 2023) |

**The trap**: 60% of government spending goes to debt interest. There is no fiscal space for investment, services, or transition.

## The Debt Trap

Egypt is caught in a debt spiral with no obvious exit. External debt service of $22-23 billion annually through 2027, combined with interest payments consuming 60% of government expenditure and 90% of revenue, leaves the state with almost no resources for anything except debt servicing.

This is not a temporary crisis. Egypt has completed 4 of 8 IMF reviews in its current $9.2 billion programme—itself an expansion of an earlier $3 billion programme that proved insufficient. The IMF cycle has become permanent: each programme provides temporary relief that enables debt service, which accumulates into the need for the next programme.

The structural reforms that might break this cycle—reducing military economic dominance, privatising state enterprises, cutting subsidies—face opposition from the regime's own power base. The IMF programmes continue; the reforms do not.

## Suez Canal Vulnerability

The Suez Canal historically provided Egypt with $8-9 billion in annual revenue—crucial foreign exchange for debt service. Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping from late 2023 through 2025 devastated this income:

- Revenue dropped to $3.7 billion (FY 2024/25 estimate)
- $800 million per month in lost revenue at peak disruption
- Recovery underway (14.2% YoY increase July-October 2025)
- FY 2025/26 projection: $6.3 billion (still below historical levels)

The Suez vulnerability reveals a deeper problem: Egypt's revenue streams are few and fragile. Tourism, remittances, and the Canal provide foreign exchange; all are vulnerable to external shocks. The economy generates little else that the world wants to buy.

## Gulf Lifelines

Egypt survives through Gulf patronage. The UAE pledged $35 billion, primarily for the Ras El Hikma tourism development on the Mediterranean coast. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states provide periodic support.

This creates dependency without development. Gulf investments in tourism and real estate do not build productive capacity. They provide foreign exchange to service debt and maintain imports—enabling Egypt to continue its current trajectory rather than forcing the structural changes that might alter it.

## Youth and Employment

Egypt's population is young and growing. Youth unemployment is endemic. The formal economy does not generate jobs at the scale required to absorb new labour market entrants.

In the AI era, the service jobs that might have absorbed educated youth (call centers, BPO, back-office operations) face automation. Egypt's workforce has neither the skills for AI-era employment nor the manufacturing base for industrial employment. Tourism and construction—the sectors that do employ—are low-productivity and vulnerable to external shocks.

## Authoritarian Brittleness

The Sisi government maintains stability through repression and patronage. This works while external support flows—Gulf investment, IMF programmes, occasional Suez windfalls. It fails when that support falters.

Egypt's 2011 revolution emerged from economic grievance combining with political repression. The same combination is rebuilding. The difference is that the global context in 2030 offers fewer employment options than 2010 did. AI will have automated more of the service jobs that might have provided a safety valve.

Authoritarian stability can persist for decades—or collapse suddenly. Egypt's fiscal position makes sudden collapse more likely than gradual reform.

## Outlook Assessment

### Near Term (2026-2028)

- IMF programme completion (2026) followed by need for successor programme
- Suez revenues partially recover but remain below historical levels
- Debt service continues consuming fiscal space
- Gulf support continues (contingent on geopolitical alignment)
- Growth of 3-4% insufficient for employment absorption

### Mid Term (2029-2032)

- Debt dynamics continue unless restructuring occurs
- Youth unemployment becomes more politically salient
- Regional instability affects Suez and tourism
- Authoritarian control tightens as economic options narrow

### Late Term (2033-2036)

**Base case**: Egypt continues in managed decline. IMF programmes roll over. Gulf patronage continues. Growth stays at 2-4% while population grows 2% annually—per capita stagnation. Repression maintains stability at increasing cost.

**Risk case**: External shock (Suez disruption, Gulf withdrawal, tourism collapse) triggers fiscal crisis. Debt restructuring becomes unavoidable. Social stability fractures. The 2011 pattern repeats but in a less forgiving global environment.

## Classification Rationale

**"Declining"** because:

1. **Debt trap**: Interest consumes 60% of spending; no fiscal space for development
2. **Revenue fragility**: Suez, tourism, remittances all vulnerable to external shocks
3. **Employment gap**: Neither formal services nor manufacturing absorb labour force growth
4. **State dependency**: Gulf patronage and IMF programmes enable stasis rather than reform
5. **Authoritarian brittleness**: Stability through repression is stable until it isn't

Egypt is not yet fracturing—the security state remains effective. But the trajectory is structural decline, with risk of sudden destabilisation if external support falters.
