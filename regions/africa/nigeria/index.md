## December 2025 Reality

Nigeria presents the demographic liability thesis in its starkest form:

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Population** | ~230 million (Africa's largest) |
| **Median age** | ~18 years |
| **GDP growth 2025** | 3.9-4.0% |
| **Official unemployment** | 4.3% |
| **Informal sector** | 93% of employment |
| **Multidimensional poverty** | 63% |
| **Income poverty** | 40% |
| **Youth (under 30)** | >50% of population |

**The liability**: The youngest population on earth enters a world where labour is what AI replaces.

## The Demographic Trap

Nigeria's population will reach 400 million by 2050—more than the United States. Half of the current population is under 30. In the twentieth-century development model, this would be an asset: young workers powering industrialisation, a demographic dividend driving growth.

In the AI era, this calculus inverts.

Nigeria has not industrialised. Manufacturing remains minimal. The oil sector, while generating two-thirds of government revenue, employs almost no one and contributes only 9% of GDP. The non-oil economy is 96.5% of GDP but consists overwhelmingly of informal sector activity—subsistence agriculture, petty trade, services—that AI neither enhances nor disrupts but simply bypasses.

What happens when 230 million people—400 million by 2050—have no role in the AI-era economy?

## The Informality Problem

93% of Nigerian employment is informal. Only 15% work as wage earners in the formal sector. This informality means:

- **No productivity gains from AI**: AI enhances formal sector productivity; it does nothing for subsistence farming or street trading
- **No tax base**: Government cannot fund services or transitions without formal employment
- **No unemployment statistics that matter**: The 4.3% official rate is meaningless when 93% work informally
- **No social safety net**: No formal employment means no contributory social insurance

The Nigerian economy exists largely outside the structures that AI transforms. This might seem protective—if AI doesn't reach the informal sector, it can't disrupt it. But it also means Nigeria cannot capture any AI gains while competing nations surge ahead.

## Oil Dependency Without Oil Employment

Nigeria's government depends on oil for two-thirds of revenue, but oil employs essentially nobody. This creates a peculiar vulnerability:

- Oil revenue finances the state
- The state is the only large-scale formal employer
- Oil prices falling (as renewables expand) means fiscal crisis
- Fiscal crisis means state employment contraction
- State employment is the only formal employment ladder

The energy transition threatens Nigeria's government revenue without AI even being involved. AI compounds the problem by eliminating the service-sector jobs that might have absorbed workers if Nigeria had developed them.

## State Capacity Failure

Nigeria's state lacks the capacity to manage the coming transition:

- **Food inflation**: Households spend 70% of income on food; food prices rose fivefold between 2019-2024
- **Infrastructure**: Power is unreliable; transport networks are inadequate; digital infrastructure is minimal
- **Governance**: Corruption endemic; extractive institutions; federal structure fragments response capacity
- **Security**: Insurgency in the northeast; banditry in the northwest; separatist pressures in the southeast

The Nigerian state cannot deliver basic services to its current population. Managing an AI-driven transition is beyond its capacity.

## Outlook Assessment

### Near Term (2026-2028)

- GDP growth continues at 3-4% (non-oil services, agriculture)
- Oil revenue pressure as energy transition accelerates globally
- Youth unemployment and underemployment intensify
- Outmigration increases for those who can leave
- Social tensions rise but do not yet fracture the state

### Mid Term (2029-2032)

- Fiscal crisis as oil revenues decline
- State capacity deteriorates further
- Informal sector expands (not because it's growing but because formal opportunities shrink)
- Security situation worsens in multiple regions
- Brain drain accelerates

### Late Term (2033-2036)

**Base case**: Nigeria muddles through with low growth, persistent poverty, and managed dysfunction. The state does not collapse but provides less and less to its citizens. GDP growth falls to 2-3% as population growth exceeds economic growth, meaning declining per-capita income.

**Risk case**: Fiscal crisis triggers political instability. Regional, ethnic, or religious fault lines fracture national coherence. Nigeria follows a trajectory toward state fragmentation or failure.

## Classification Rationale

**"Declining"** because:

1. **Demographic liability**: Youngest population on earth entering an era where labour is devalued
2. **Structural bypass**: 93% informal economy means AI gains flow elsewhere entirely
3. **Fiscal fragility**: Oil revenue dependency as energy transition accelerates
4. **State incapacity**: Government cannot manage the population it has, let alone a transition
5. **No alternative path**: Manufacturing didn't develop; services won't absorb; agriculture is subsistence

Nigeria illustrates the dark side of demographics in the AI era. A billion people is an asset when you need labour. When labour is what AI replaces, a billion people becomes a burden that states cannot support and economies cannot employ.

## Implications

### For International Community

- Nigeria's trajectory affects regional stability across West Africa
- Migration pressure will intensify as opportunities shrink
- Aid and development models designed for labour-based growth are obsolete

### For Businesses

- Limited formal market growth despite population expansion
- Consumer economy constrained by poverty and informality
- Resource extraction remains viable; everything else is challenging

### For Individuals

- Emigration is the highest-return strategy for the skilled
- Informal sector survival rather than formal economy participation
- Education provides limited returns without formal employment destinations
