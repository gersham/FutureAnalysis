## December 2025 Reality

South Africa's structural challenges are quantified:

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **GDP growth 2025** | ~1.2% (OECD) |
| **Unemployment** | 32%+ national; ~40% youth |
| **Load shedding status** | Returned January 2025 |
| **GDP cost of load shedding** | 1-1.3% annually since 2007 |
| **Daily economic loss (outages)** | $85-230 million |
| **Government energy plan** | R2.2 trillion (~30% of GDP) |
| **Eskom energy availability** | ~70% (improved from 48% at peak crisis) |

**The crisis**: South Africa cannot keep the lights on. An economy cannot grow when power is unreliable.

## The Electricity Crisis

South Africa has been in rolling electricity crisis since 2007. Load shedding—scheduled blackouts to prevent grid collapse—has become endemic. After a brief respite in early 2024, load shedding returned in late January 2025, with Stage 5 or 6 blackouts possible during winter months.

The impact is structural, not cyclical:

- **GDP reduction of 1-1.3% annually** since 2007 attributable to load shedding
- **Daily economic losses of $85-230 million** during active load shedding
- **Potential output decline**: Average growth fell from 3.9% (2000-2009) to 1.4% post-financial crisis, with load shedding as primary factor

The government announced an R2.2 trillion (approximately 30% of GDP) energy transformation plan. Eskom, the state utility, projects potential profitability in 2025—its first in eight years. Energy availability has improved from 48% at peak crisis to approximately 70%.

But "improved" is not "solved." The infrastructure is aged, maintenance backlogs persist, and new capacity takes years to build. South Africa will remain electricity-constrained throughout the forecast period.

## Unemployment Crisis

South Africa's unemployment rate exceeds 32%—among the highest in the world. Youth unemployment approaches 40%. These are not cyclical figures; they reflect a structural mismatch between labour supply and economic demand that has persisted for decades.

In the AI era, this gets worse, not better:

- The service jobs that might absorb workers are being automated globally
- South Africa's manufacturing base never developed
- Mining, historically an employer, is increasingly automated
- The informal sector already absorbs those the formal economy cannot employ

Employment effects from electricity outages compound the AI impact. Research shows both employment and working hours decline with outage intensity, with small firms particularly vulnerable.

## The Inequality Trap

South Africa is the world's most unequal society by most measures. The legacy of apartheid combined with post-apartheid policy failures has created a dual economy:

- A first-world sector (finance, professional services, mining corporates) that is globally competitive
- A majority population excluded from that economy, employed informally or not at all

AI amplifies this split. The first-world sector will adopt AI and potentially thrive. The majority population, already excluded from the formal economy, gains nothing from productivity improvements in sectors they don't participate in.

## Governance Failure

The ANC government has presided over state capture, infrastructure decay, and service delivery collapse. The 2024 national elections forced a coalition government—the first since 1994—but coalition governance has not yet reversed the decline.

The state lacks capacity to:
- Maintain existing infrastructure (Eskom, water systems, roads)
- Provide services (healthcare, education, policing) at adequate levels
- Implement the reforms that might attract investment

Private sector workarounds (private security, generator-dependent businesses, private healthcare) create resilience for those who can afford them. The majority cannot.

## Outlook Assessment

### Near Term (2026-2028)

- Load shedding continues as structural feature
- GDP growth constrained to 1-2%
- Unemployment remains above 30%
- Coalition government stability uncertain
- Emigration of skilled workers continues

### Mid Term (2029-2032)

- New generation capacity slowly comes online
- Electricity situation stabilises (not solves)
- GDP growth may reach 2% if power improves
- Unemployment remains structural
- Social stability maintained through grants and patronage

### Late Term (2033-2036)

**Base case**: South Africa stabilises at low growth (1-2%). Electricity crisis moderates but doesn't resolve. Unemployment persists as structural feature. The country functions but does not develop. Middle-income trap becomes permanent.

**Risk case**: Infrastructure failure cascades (electricity + water + transport). Social stability fractures. Skilled emigration accelerates. Investment flight. South Africa follows Zimbabwe trajectory rather than developing-economy trajectory.

## Classification Rationale

**"Declining"** because:

1. **Infrastructure failure**: Cannot keep the lights on; this alone caps growth
2. **Structural unemployment**: 32%+ with no absorption mechanism
3. **Governance incapacity**: State cannot maintain infrastructure or deliver services
4. **Inequality trap**: Dual economy means AI gains accrue to small elite only
5. **No growth path**: Neither manufacturing nor services developed at scale

South Africa is Africa's most developed economy—but "most developed" is relative. The electricity crisis alone would justify a declining outlook. Combined with structural unemployment, governance failure, and inequality, the trajectory is clear.
