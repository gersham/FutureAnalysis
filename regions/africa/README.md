# Africa: 2026-2036

*Synthesis of: [Nigeria](nigeria/README.md) | [South Africa](south-africa/README.md)*

## December 2025 Reality

Africa presents the starkest illustration of demographic liability in the AI era:

| Country | Population | Median Age | Informal Economy | Outlook |
|---------|------------|------------|------------------|---------|
| **Nigeria** | ~230 million | ~18 years | 93% | Declining |
| **South Africa** | ~60 million | ~28 years | High | Declining |

**Continental context**: Africa's population will reach 2.5 billion by 2050. The youngest continent enters an era where labour is what AI replaces.

Africa's trajectory in the AI era is shaped by a fundamental mismatch: the continent has abundant labour when the world needs less of it.

The twentieth-century development model—young workers powering industrialisation, a demographic dividend driving growth—assumed labour scarcity. Factories needed workers. Services needed staff. Growth required people. Countries with young, growing populations could follow East Asian tigers toward manufacturing-led development.

AI inverts this calculus. Labour is increasingly abundant relative to demand. The service jobs that might have absorbed African workers are being automated. Manufacturing is increasingly roboticised. The demographic dividend becomes demographic burden when there's nowhere for the workers to work.

[Nigeria](nigeria/README.md) exemplifies this trap at continental scale. With 230 million people (400 million by 2050) and a median age of 18, Nigeria has the youngest population of any major economy. But 93% work in the informal sector—subsistence agriculture, petty trade, services—that AI neither enhances nor disrupts but simply bypasses. The Nigerian economy exists largely outside the structures that AI transforms. This might seem protective, but it means Nigeria captures no AI gains while competing nations surge ahead. Oil revenue finances the state but employs almost no one. When oil revenues decline (as energy transition proceeds), fiscal crisis meets employment crisis meets the world's youngest population. The outcome is structural decline, with risk of state fragmentation.

[South Africa](south-africa/README.md) represents a different failure mode: the most developed African economy that nevertheless cannot provide basic services. Load shedding—rolling blackouts—has constrained growth since 2007, reducing GDP by 1-1.3% annually. Unemployment exceeds 32%, with youth unemployment near 40%. These are not cyclical figures but structural features of an economy that never generated employment at the scale required.

South Africa's dual economy—a globally competitive first-world sector (finance, mining corporates, professional services) alongside a majority population excluded from formal employment—previews the AI-era pattern for developed economies. AI amplifies this split: the first-world sector adopts AI and thrives; the majority population, already excluded, gains nothing from productivity improvements in sectors they don't participate in.

Neither Nigeria nor South Africa has built the manufacturing base that enabled Asian development. Neither has the service-sector capacity that powered India's growth (and which is now being disrupted). Neither has the infrastructure—electricity, logistics, digital—that AI-era economic activity requires.

The African trajectory is not uniform—Botswana, Rwanda, Kenya, and others show different patterns. But the continent's two largest economies illustrate the fundamental challenge: large, young populations entering an era where labour is devalued, in economies that never built alternative paths to development.
