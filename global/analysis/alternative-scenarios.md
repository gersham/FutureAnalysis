# Alternative Scenarios

> **Purpose**: Stress-test the core thesis against plausible alternative futures

The base case assumes AI displacement at ~5% annually, US dominance in AI infrastructure, and continued institutional erosion in Western democracies. This document explores scenarios where key assumptions prove wrong.

---

## Scenario 1: AI Winter 2.0

**Trigger**: Capability plateau; models fail to improve meaningfully beyond 2025-2026 levels despite continued investment.

### Probability: Low (15-20%)

### Mechanism
- Scaling laws hit diminishing returns
- Next-generation models show marginal improvements at exponential cost
- Enterprise ROI fails to materialise; adoption stalls
- Investment pulls back sharply (Stargate-style projects cancelled)

### Implications

| Category | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Winners | US advantage erodes; China catches up without massive investment |
| Declining | Germany/Europe partially recover as competitive disadvantage shrinks |
| Fracturing | UK/France avoid worst outcomes; services economies stabilise |
| Displacement | 5% thesis falsified; reversion to historical automation rates |

### Signals to Watch
- Model benchmark improvements slow significantly (2026-2027)
- Major AI companies miss revenue targets repeatedly
- Enterprise AI budgets cut >30%
- Stargate-type projects scaled back or cancelled

## Scenario 2: Regulatory Success (EU Model Spreads)

**Trigger**: EU AI Act proves workable; other jurisdictions adopt similar frameworks; "human in the loop" becomes global standard.

### Probability: Low (10-15%)

### Mechanism
- EU Digital Omnibus successfully balances innovation and safety
- Compliance costs prove manageable; SMEs adapt
- US adopts federal AI regulation under political pressure
- China implements parallel constraints (for domestic stability)
- Global deployment slows to coordinated pace

### Implications

| Category | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Displacement | Slower but still proceeds; extends timeline to 2040+ |
| Europe | Competitive position stabilises; avoids worst outcomes |
| US | Loses "move fast" advantage; levels playing field |
| Services economies | Breathing room; can adapt more gradually |

### Signals to Watch
- US federal AI legislation passes (2026-2027)
- Major EU tech companies gain market share
- AI deployment rates converge across regions
- EU "high performers" percentage approaches US levels

---

## Scenario 3: Taiwan Conflict

**Trigger**: China attempts reunification by force; US intervenes or imposes severe sanctions.

### Probability: Moderate (20-30% by 2030)

### Mechanism
- Military conflict or blockade disrupts semiconductor supply
- TSMC capacity destroyed, captured, or sanctioned
- Global chip shortage far exceeding 2020-2021 crisis
- AI infrastructure buildout halts; existing capacity rationed

### Implications

| Category | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| China | "Winner" → "Fracturing" regardless of military outcome |
| US | Severe disruption but domestic fabs partially compensate |
| Japan/Korea | Caught in crossfire; severe economic impact |
| Europe | Supply shock; but reduced competitive pressure |
| AI timeline | Delayed 3-5 years; displacement thesis postponed |

### Signals to Watch
- Chinese military exercises around Taiwan increase frequency/scale
- US accelerates CHIPS Act implementation
- Companies diversify away from Taiwan (already underway)
- Insurance markets price Taiwan risk higher

---

## Scenario 4: DeepSeek Paradigm (Efficiency Trumps Scale)

**Trigger**: Chinese approach (algorithmic efficiency at low cost) proves superior to US approach (massive scale/investment).

### Probability: Moderate (25-35%)

### Mechanism
- DeepSeek-style models achieve frontier performance at 1/100th cost
- Inference cost collapse continues (280x decline continues)
- Massive data centres become stranded assets
- AI deployment democratises; small players compete with hyperscalers

### Implications

| Category | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| US | Data centre advantage partially stranded; China achieves parity |
| China | "Winner" status strengthened despite lower investment |
| Europe | Can deploy competitive AI without infrastructure investment |
| Stargate | Overcapitalised; returns disappoint |
| Displacement | Accelerates (cheaper = faster deployment) |

### Signals to Watch
- Chinese models consistently match US performance on benchmarks
- Inference costs continue 10x+ annual declines
- SMEs deploy frontier-equivalent models on commodity hardware
- Hyperscaler margins compress

---

## Scenario 5: Robotics Acceleration (China Leads)

**Trigger**: Chinese manufacturers (BYD, Unitree) achieve mass production while Western competitors struggle.

### Probability: Moderate (30-40%)

### Mechanism
- Unitree R1 ($5,900) proves viable at scale
- BYD hits 20,000 unit target in 2026; scales to 100,000+ by 2028
- Tesla Optimus continues production delays
- China deploys humanoids in manufacturing while West still piloting

### Implications

| Category | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| China | Second wave arrives 2-3 years ahead of West |
| Manufacturing | Chinese factories automate faster; cost advantage compounds |
| Blue-collar displacement | Hits China first but at higher growth rate |
| West | Faces both AI and robotics import competition |

### Signals to Watch
- BYD/Unitree production numbers meet targets
- Tesla Optimus continues missing targets through 2026
- Chinese manufacturing employment drops despite output growth
- Humanoid robot exports begin (2027+)

## Scenario 6: Western Institutional Resilience

**Trigger**: Democratic institutions absorb AI shock better than expected; adaptation occurs faster than displacement.

### Probability: Low-Moderate (15-25%)

### Mechanism
- UBI or equivalent programmes implemented effectively
- Retraining programmes actually work (unlike historical precedent)
- Political systems produce competent responses
- Social cohesion maintained through transition

### Implications

| Category | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Fracturing | UK/France avoid worst outcomes; "Survivor" category |
| Declining | Germany manages transition; stagnation not collapse |
| Legitimacy | Institutions gain credibility by handling crisis |
| Displacement | Still occurs but absorbed without destabilisation |

### Signals to Watch
- Major Western economies implement meaningful safety net reforms
- Unemployment rises but social unrest doesn't follow
- Trust in government stabilises or rises
- Political extremism doesn't gain further ground

---

## Scenario 7: Black Swan (Unknown Unknown)

**Trigger**: Unanticipated event fundamentally alters trajectory.

### Examples
- Pandemic 2.0 with higher mortality
- Major war in Europe (Russia-NATO)
- Climate tipping point acceleration
- AI capability breakthrough (AGI) or catastrophic failure
- Financial system collapse

### Probability: Uncertain (historically, ~one major black swan per decade)

### Implication
- All projections become unreliable
- Scenario planning value: mental preparation, not prediction

## Scenario Probability Summary

| Scenario | Probability | Impact on Base Case |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Base case holds | 35-45% | — |
| AI Winter 2.0 | 15-20% | Thesis falsified |
| Regulatory Success | 10-15% | Timeline extended |
| Taiwan Conflict | 20-30% (by 2030) | Major disruption |
| DeepSeek Paradigm | 25-35% | US advantage erodes; displacement accelerates |
| Robotics Acceleration (China) | 30-40% | China extends lead |
| Western Resilience | 15-25% | "Fracturing" → "Survivor" |
| Black Swan | ~10%/year | Unknown |

**Note**: Probabilities are not mutually exclusive; multiple scenarios can occur simultaneously.

## Using This Analysis

1. **Track signals**: Monitor indicators for each scenario
2. **Update priors**: Adjust projections as evidence accumulates
3. **Hedge exposure**: Geographic/asset diversification across scenarios
4. **Avoid overconfidence**: Base case is most likely but not certain

The goal is not to predict the future with precision but to understand the range of plausible futures and position accordingly.
