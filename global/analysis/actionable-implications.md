# Actionable Implications

> **Supposition**: Individuals can and should take concrete actions based on this analysis

## Core Principles

For individuals navigating this transition, the implications are stark:

### 1. Geographic Mobility Matters
Being in the wrong country as it fractures is not a recoverable error.

**Actions:**
- Assess current location against trajectory categories
- If in "Fracturing" category, develop exit options before they're needed
- Citizenship/residency optionality is valuable
- Consider proximity to stable jurisdictions

### 2. Asset Diversification Matters
Resources in multiple jurisdictions provide resilience against localised collapse.

**Actions:**
- Hold assets in multiple currencies/jurisdictions
- Consider real assets in resource-rich stable countries
- Reduce concentration in single-country financial systems
- Crypto/DeFi provides jurisdiction-agnostic optionality (with own risks)

### 3. Clear-Eyed Assessment Matters
Normalcy bias—the assumption that tomorrow will resemble today—is the most dangerous cognitive error in a period of discontinuous change.

**Actions:**
- Actively counter normalcy bias
- Monitor leading indicators, not lagging confirmation
- Trust structural analysis over reassuring narratives
- Prepare for scenarios that feel unlikely but are structurally plausible

## By Situation

### If Currently in a "Winner" Country
- Capture upside: AI skills, tech exposure, energy/resource sector
- Still diversify internationally (no country immune to all risks)
- Watch for regulatory self-harm (US could still sabotage itself)

### If Currently in a "Restructured" Country (Canada)
- Understand who captures the gains (institutional investors, resource sector)
- Position accordingly or accept being on wrong side of distribution
- Services economy in major cities will contract; adjust career/location

### If Currently in a "Survivor" Country
- Managed decline is liveable but not prosperous
- Consider whether stagnation is acceptable vs seeking dynamism elsewhere
- These countries offer stability, not growth

### If Currently in a "Declining" Country
- The trend is structural, not cyclical
- Political change will not reverse economic trajectory
- Exit optionality is valuable even if not exercised
- Young people should seriously consider relocation

### If Currently in a "Fracturing" Country
- Highest urgency for action
- Civil instability is difficult to navigate even with resources
- Waiting for confirmation of fracture may mean waiting too long
- UK and France specifically warrant serious consideration of alternatives

## Career Implications

### High-Risk Careers
- Financial services (especially entry-level, back-office)
- Legal services (research, document review)
- Administrative/coordination roles
- Junior positions in automatable fields
- Public sector in high-exposure countries

### Lower-Risk Careers
- AI/ML development and deployment
- Energy infrastructure
- Critical minerals/resources
- Healthcare (clinical, not administrative)
- Skilled trades (until robotics wave matures)
- Roles requiring physical presence + judgment

### Adaptation Strategy
- Assume current role has 5-10 year automation horizon
- Build skills that complement rather than compete with AI
- Consider geography as part of career planning
- Entrepreneurship in growing sectors > employment in declining ones

## Investment Implications

### Favoured Geographies
- United States (AI, energy, infrastructure)
- Australia (critical minerals, energy)
- Select Asian markets (adoption leaders)

### Disfavoured Geographies
- UK financial services
- European services generally
- High-regulation jurisdictions

### Sector Views
- Long: AI infrastructure, energy, critical minerals
- Short/Avoid: Traditional financial services, European professional services

## Timeline for Action

| Timeframe | Priority |
|-----------|----------|
| **Now - 2026** | Assess situation; build optionality (citizenship, assets, skills) |
| **2026-2028** | Early displacement visible; exercise options if needed |
| **2029-2032** | Categories solidifying; harder to move between them |
| **2033+** | New equilibrium; options exercised or forfeited |
