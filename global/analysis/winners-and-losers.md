# Winners and Losers Framework

> **Supposition**: Nations will diverge dramatically based on their position relative to AI, energy, resources, and social cohesion
> **Confidence**: Moderate-High on categories; Lower on specific magnitudes

## Note on Growth Outlooks

We use **qualitative growth outlooks** (High / Moderate / Low / Negative / Uneven) instead of numeric GDP projections. These reflect relative positioning within the factor model and sector exposure in the 5%/year displacement scenario.

## The Determining Variables

### What Makes a Winner
1. **AI ownership**: Create or control AI systems
2. **Energy abundance**: Cheap, reliable power for data centres
3. **Natural resources**: Critical minerals, energy sources
4. **Cultural adoption**: Willingness to deploy aggressively
5. **Regulatory environment**: Not self-sabotaging through compliance burden

### What Makes a Loser
1. **Service economy dependence**: Financial intermediation, professional consultancy, administrative processing
2. **Energy constraints**: High costs, limited capacity
3. **Regulatory burden**: EU AI Act or similar
4. **Pre-existing fractures**: Legitimacy deficits, demographic tensions

## Projected Outcomes by Category

### Winners
Countries capturing AI transition gains.

| Country | Growth Outlook | Confidence | Key Factors |
|---------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| United States | High | High | Dominant on all dimensions |
| China | High | Moderate | State capacity; Taiwan risk; DeepSeek efficiency |
| Australia | High | Moderate | Resources; regulatory risk |
| Poland | High | Moderate | Manufacturing; less exposed |
| Vietnam | High | Moderate | Manufacturing shift; young population |
| Indonesia | High | Moderate | Scale; resources; adoption rates |
| UAE/Saudi Arabia | High | Moderate | Sovereign wealth; energy; infra |

### Restructured
Gains exist but captured unequally.

| Country | Growth Outlook | Confidence | Key Factors |
|---------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Canada | Moderate (Uneven/Concentrated) | Moderate | Resources via state‑capital model |

### Survivors
Managing transition with stability.

| Country | Growth Outlook | Confidence | Key Factors |
|---------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Singapore | Moderate | Moderate | Technocratic adaptation |
| Japan | Moderate | High | Demographic cushion; managed stagnation |
| South Korea | Moderate | Moderate | Tech sector strength; demographic pressure |

### Declining
Structural contraction or stagnation.

| Country | Growth Outlook | Confidence | Key Factors |
|---------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Germany | Low/Negative | High | Energy costs; structural headwinds |
| Switzerland | Low/Negative | Moderate | Banking model under pressure |
| Italy | Low/Negative | Moderate | Debt; demographics; no tech sector |
| Russia | Low/Negative | Moderate | Sanctions; brain drain; commodity dependence |

### Contested
Genuinely uncertain; high variance outcomes.

| Country | Growth Outlook | Confidence | Key Factors |
|---------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Ireland | Uncertain (High variance) | Low | Tech HQ dependency; diversification potential |
| Turkey | Uncertain (High variance) | Low | Geopolitics; instability risk |
| Thailand | Uncertain (High variance) | Low | Manufacturing potential; political uncertainty |

### Fracturing
Economic decline + elevated instability risk.

| Country | Growth Outlook | Confidence | Key Factors |
|---------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| United Kingdom | Negative with instability risk | Moderate | Services exposure; legitimacy crisis |
| France | Negative with instability risk | Moderate | Public sector + social fractures |

### Collapsing
State failure or near-failure likely.

| Country | Decade Trajectory | Confidence | Key Factors |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| Iran | Severe contraction | High | Sanctions; regime instability |
| Venezuela | Continued collapse | High | Already failed state |

## Falsifiable Criteria

### Winner Status Confirmed If:
- GDP growth exceeds 3% annually for 3+ consecutive years
- Data centre capacity expands according to pipeline projections
- No major civil unrest events

### Fracturing Status Confirmed If:
- GDP contracts 2%+ for 2+ consecutive years
- Major civil unrest in 3+ cities
- Infrastructure attacks on power/communications
- Regional autonomy movements gain legal traction

## Timeline

| Period | Expected Development |
|--------|---------------------|
| Near (2026-2028) | Divergence becomes visible; early displacement effects |
| Mid (2029-2032) | Categories solidify; fracturing nations show instability |
| Late (2033-2036) | New equilibrium; map fundamentally redrawn |

## Key Uncertainties

| Factor | Impact If True | Impact If False |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| DeepSeek-style efficiency gains | China parity despite lower investment; US capital advantage erodes | US dominance holds |
| EU AI Act relaxation (Digital Omnibus) | Europe partially recovers | Europe falls further behind |
| Taiwan conflict | China "Winner" → "Fracturing"; global supply shock | Status quo |
| Robotics timeline slips 2-3 years | Second wave delayed; blue-collar less affected near-term | Displacement compounds faster |
| US political instability escalates | "Winner" status complicated; domestic fracturing | Thesis holds |
