# The View from 2035

> **Supposition**: A projection of what the world looks like at the end of the forecast period

## The Transformed Landscape

By 2035, the map of power and prosperity will look nothing like 2020.

### United States: Consolidated Dominance
- Dominant economy, AI companies generating wealth at scales dwarfing 20th-century oil fortunes
- Political instability has not derailed technological and economic transformation
- Dollar remains reserve currency because there is no alternative
- Wealth concentration among AI-owning firms and their employees

### Asia: The Adoption Advantage Proven
- China, India, and Southeast Asian nations that embraced AI have captured productivity gains
- Europe debated regulations while Asia deployed
- Humanoid robotics wave arriving in force, transforming physical labour
- Regional supply chains increasingly self-sufficient

### Europe: Regulatory Failure Demonstrated
- EU AI Act and human oversight requirements imposed costs without preventing AI deployment
- AI deployed by non-European competitors against European firms
- The "human in the loop" became the human holding the bag
- Some nations adapted despite regulatory environment (Poland, Netherlands)
- Others discovered civilisational decline is not a metaphor (Germany, France, UK)

### Canada: The Model Tested
- Resources developed via state de-risking, owned by institutional capital
- Infrastructure operating under treaty-protected concessions for decades
- Question of whether this produces broad prosperity or rentier dependency answered
- Political bargain (infrastructure delivery for institutional ownership) made visible

### Financial Centres: Hollowed Out
- London, Singapore, Zurich, Luxembourg, Dublin all diminished
- Intermediation proved vulnerable when AI intermediates better
- Alternative finance disintermediates entirely
- Wealth flows through algorithms and protocols
- Captured by system builders, not system operators

### Professional-Managerial Class: Displaced
- The people whose jobs were to run things discovered AI runs things better and cheaper
- Administrators, regulators, managers, communicators—economically devastated
- Ideology persists in institutional residue
- Material base collapsed
- What replaces them shapes politics of 2030s and beyond

## The Numbers

| Country | 2025 Status | 2035 Status | GDP Change (Cumulative) |
|---------|-------------|-------------|------------------------|
| United States | 53.7 GW | 100+ GW | +50-70% |
| China | 32 GW | 60+ GW | +40-60% |
| Australia | 1.3 GW | 5+ GW | +30-50% |
| Poland | Growing | Grown | +30-40% |
| Canada | 1.2 GW | 4-5 GW | +20-40% (concentrated) |
| Singapore | 1 GW | Constrained | +20-40% |
| Japan | 1.5 GW | 3-4 GW | +10-20% |
| Germany | 0.8 GW | 2 GW | -20 to -40% |
| Switzerland | - | - | -10 to -20% |
| Ireland | - | - | -10 to +20% |
| France | - | - | -20 to -40% |
| United Kingdom | 1 GW | 2-3 GW | -30 to -60% |

## What Did Not Change

Predictions of what persists:
- US dollar as reserve currency (no alternative emerged)
- Nation-state as primary political unit (despite predictions of obsolescence)
- Human desire for meaning, status, community (channeled differently)
- Geographic variation in outcomes (no uniform global trajectory)

## What Surprised

Areas of uncertainty that could resolve either way:
- Speed of robotics deployment (could be faster or slower)
- Degree of social instability (could be more or less than projected)
- Political responses (populism, authoritarianism, or something new)
- Black swans (Taiwan conflict, pandemic, technological discontinuity)
