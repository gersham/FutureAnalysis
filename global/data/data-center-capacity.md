| AI-related capacity needed by 2030 | — | — | 156 GW |
| Total AI data center investment by 2030 | — | — | $5.2 trillion |

## Current Capacity and Pipeline (Validated)

| Country/Region | 2025 Installed (GW) | 2030 Projected (GW) | Assessment |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------|
| United States | 53.7 | 132 | Dominant |
| China | 31.9 | 50+ | Major Power (80% of new capacity idle) |
| European Union | 11.9 | 41 | Trailing but tripling |
| Asia-Pacific (ex-China) | 12.2 | 26.1 | 21% CAGR |
| Japan + South Korea | 6.6 (combined) | 10-12 | Constrained |
| Australia | 1.3-2.2 | 3.1-4.1 | Rising rapidly |
| Canada | ~1.2 | 3-5 | Policy Dependent |
| United Kingdom | ~1.0 | 2-3 | Inadequate |
| Germany | ~0.8 | 1.5-2 | Energy Crisis |

## Key Infrastructure Projects

### United States: Stargate Project
The largest AI infrastructure project in history, announced January 2025:
- **Total commitment**: $500 billion over 4 years (through 2029)
- **Initial funding**: $100 billion (SoftBank + OpenAI each $19B, Oracle + MGX each $7B)
- **Current capacity**: Nearly 7 GW planned across 6 sites
- **Target**: 10 GW by end of 2025
- **Employment**: 6,000+ construction workers daily; 1,700 long-term jobs per site; 100,000+ jobs total

**Project Timeline and Challenges**:

| Period | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Jan 2025 | Announced at White House with $500B commitment |
| Feb-Jul 2025 | Significant delays; Bloomberg reported no funds raised, disputes between OpenAI/SoftBank over locations |
| Aug 2025 | SoftBank acknowledged project "taking longer than anticipated" |
| Sept 2025 | Recovery announced: 5 new sites, $400B committed, back on track for 10 GW |
| Dec 2025 | Abilene flagship operational; Oracle delivering NVIDIA GB200 racks |

**Risk assessment**: Project has demonstrated resilience after mid-2025 setbacks, but remains dependent on continued capital availability and OpenAI-SoftBank alignment. Market uncertainty and trade policy could trigger further delays.

**Stargate Sites (as of Sept 2025)**:
1. Abilene, Texas (flagship) — operational
2. Shackelford County, Texas
3. Milam County, Texas
4. Doña Ana County, New Mexico
5. Lordstown, Ohio
6. Wisconsin (Midwest site with Oracle/Vantage)

**International expansion**: UAE Stargate (opening 2026), Stargate Norway (OpenAI for Countries), Stargate Argentina ($25B commitment, up to 500 MW)

### Virginia Data Center Corridor
- 12+ GW installed capacity
- Largest concentration in the world
- Continued rapid expansion

### China
- 31.9 GW installed, but **up to 80%** of recently added capacity sits idle
- Aggressive state-directed expansion continues
- Targeting 50+ GW by 2030
- $138 billion government AI/quantum fund announced (March 2025)

### European Union
- Current: 11.9 GW (less than quarter of US levels)
- **Expected to triple** to 41 GW by 2030
- Requires up to **$300 billion** in investment
- Electricity demand from data centers to rise **150%** by 2035
- Frankfurt hub constrained by energy costs (3-4x US levels)
- Dublin at grid capacity, facing moratoriums on new connections
- London lacks cheap power and expansion land

### Australia
- Current capacity: 1.3-2.2 GW (sources vary)
- Projected: 3.1-4.1 GW by 2030
- **Supply gap**: 0.7-1.7 GW expected by 2028
- **Major investments**: Amazon AUD $20B, Microsoft AUD $5B
- Challenges: Grid capacity and electricity costs in Sydney/Melbourne

## Energy Cost Differentials (Validated December 2025)

| Region | Wholesale (vs US) | Industrial (vs US) | Household | Impact |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------| ----------|--------|
| United States | 1x (~$48/MWh) | 1x | ~$0.12/kWh | Competitive advantage |
| Germany | ~2x wholesale | 2-4x industrial | $0.38/kWh (highest in EU) | Driving deindustrialization |
| EU average | ~2x wholesale | ~2x industrial | ~$0.25/kWh | Significant headwind |
| China | ~1.5x | Similar to US | — | Closing gap |
| Australia | 1.5-2x | 1.5-2x | — | Grid constraints emerging |

**Note**: EU industrial prices are 2-4x higher than main trading partners (US, China) per European Commission 2025 report. This threatens long-term competitiveness of European industry, particularly energy-intensive data centre operations.

## Market Concentration

- **US share**: 44% of global capacity (60% of operating capacity per Q2 2025)
- **US + China**: 70% of global total
- **Top 18 US markets**: 4.9 GW capacity (+26% YoY growth)

## Investment Requirements

| Region | Investment Needed (2025-2030) |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| Asia-Pacific (total pipeline) | $116 billion |
| Australia (pipeline buildout) | $15.5 billion |
| Europe (capacity tripling) | ~$300 billion |
| Global AI capacity | $5.2 trillion |
