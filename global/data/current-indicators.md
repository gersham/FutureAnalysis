# Current Global Indicators

*Snapshot of key metrics driving the analysis. Updated periodically.*

## Artificial Intelligence & Compute
*   **Investment:** $109B private investment in US (2024) vs $8B in EU.
*   **Adoption:** 93% of Chinese knowledge workers use AI vs 39% US (KPMG 2025).
*   **Infrastructure:** US data center capacity ~54GW (44% global share).
*   **Cost:** Inference costs dropping ~70% annually (Moore's Law for AI).

## Economic & Demographic
*   **Interest Rates:** Structural floor likely higher than 2010s due to inflation/debt.
*   **Demographics:** China population decline ~800k-2M/year. Japan -800k/year.
*   **Energy:** EU industrial electricity spread vs US ~2-3x.

## European Financial Stress Indicators
*   **OAT-Bund Spread:** France-Germany 10-year bond spread ~80-90 bps (Dec 2024), highest since 2012 eurozone crisis. A spread of 80-100 bps is consistent with France credit downgrade to single-A.
*   **TARGET2 Balances:** Germany creditor position ~€1.1tn; Italy debtor ~€500bn; Spain debtor ~€500bn. Total imbalances ~€1.6tn. These have persisted since 2012 but represent transmission mechanism for sovereign stress.
*   **French Deficit:** 5.8% GDP (2024), projected 5.5% (2025). EU rules require <3%. Public debt 116% GDP.
*   **German Manufacturing PMI:** 42.5 (Dec 2024), 18+ consecutive months of contraction.

## Robotics (Status Check: Late 2025)
*   **Tesla Optimus:** Gen 3 unveiled (Oct 2025); autonomous learning demonstrated.
*   **Figure AI:** Commercial pilots with BMW.
*   **BYD:** Aggressive scaling (1500+ units planned).
*   **Unit Cost:** Target price <$20k/unit by 2030.

*Note: These figures serve as the baseline for the "Fracturing" scenario. Significant deviations from these baselines constitute grounds for revising the probability of outcomes.*
