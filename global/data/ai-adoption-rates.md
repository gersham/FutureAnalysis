# AI Adoption Rates by Country

*Survey data on organizational adoption and citizen optimism, December 2025.*

## Organizational AI Adoption

### Enterprise AI Usage (McKinsey Global Survey, Nov 2025)
| Metric | 2024 | 2025 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Organizations using AI in at least one function | 78% | 88% | +10pp |
| Generative AI adoption | 65% | 72% | +7pp |
| Scaling AI programs enterprise-wide | ~25% | ~33% | +8pp |
| High performers capturing disproportionate value | — | 6% | — |

### Regional AI Adoption (BCG Survey, July 2025)
| Country/Region | Adoption Rate | Notes |
|----------------|---------------|-------|
| India | 92% | Highest globally |
| North America | 79% | Led by US tech sector |
| Western Europe | 70% | Strong recent growth |
| China | 50-58% | Active commercial deployment |
| Southeast Asia | 59% | Cautious leadership |
| South Korea | 64% | Conservative enterprise culture |
| Japan | 51-56% | Lowest in Asia-Pacific |

### US-Specific Adoption Metrics
| Measure | Rate | Source |
|---------|------|--------|
| All US businesses using AI | 9.7% | US Census (Aug 2025) |
| Information sector companies | 25% | US Census |
| IT and telecommunications | 38% | Industry analysis |
| Companies meaningfully scaling AI | ~25% | Enterprise surveys |

**Key insight**: The gap between "any AI use" (88% McKinsey) and "meaningful deployment" (9.7-25%) reflects the difference between experimentation and operational transformation. Only 6% of organizations are "high performers" capturing disproportionate value.

## Citizen Optimism and Trust in AI

### Global Optimism Rankings (KPMG/University of Melbourne, 2025)
| Country | "AI offers more benefits than risks" | Trust in AI |
|---------|--------------------------------------|-------------|
| China | 83% | 68% |
| Indonesia | 80% | High |
| Thailand | 77% | High |
| India | 74% | High |
| UAE | 72% | High |
| Malaysia | 68% | 68% |
| Netherlands | 36% | Lower |
| United States | 39% | Lower |
| Canada | 40% | Lower |

### AI Embrace Rate (Edelman Trust Barometer 2025)
| Country | "Embrace AI use" |
|---------|------------------|
| China | 54% |
| United States | 17% |

**Key finding**: Chinese respondents are approximately **3x more likely** to embrace AI than Americans (54% vs 17%), and roughly **2x more optimistic** about benefits (83% vs 39%).

## The American Paradox (Updated)

The United States creates AI but is not the nation that adopts it fastest:
- **Census data**: Only 9.7% of US businesses actively using AI (Aug 2025)
- **Enterprise level**: 88% experimenting, but only 33% scaling programs
- **High performers**: Just 6% are capturing transformative value
- Americans significantly more wary than Chinese or Indian populations

**However**, what matters for national outcomes is **frontier adoption**, not average adoption:
- US private AI investment: **$109.1 billion** (2024)—12x China, 24x UK
- US companies produced **40 notable AI models** in 2024 vs China's 15
- American data centres: **53.7 GW** (44% of global capacity)
- Stargate project: $500 billion commitment through 2029

The cultural wariness of middle America is economically irrelevant when the firms that generate American wealth are AI-native.

## The DeepSeek Disruption (2025)

A critical development challenging the US investment advantage:

### Performance Parity at Fraction of Cost

Stanford HAI AI Index 2025 found top US and Chinese models achieved **near parity** on benchmarks by end of 2024:

| Benchmark | US Lead Over China |
|-----------|-------------------|
| MMLU | 0.3% |
| MMMU | 8.1% |
| MATH | 1.6% |
| HumanEval | 3.7% |

**DeepSeek-V3 and R1** perform competitively with training costs in the **low millions**, compared to US models costing **$100 million to $1 billion** to train.

### Implications

1. **Investment advantage may not translate to capability advantage**: China achieving parity despite 12x lower private investment
2. **Cost efficiency matters**: If Chinese models cost 1/100th to train with similar performance, capital intensity may not be the moat assumed
3. **Inference cost collapse**: Stanford reports inference costs dropped **280x** in 2024-2025 period
4. **Sanctions impact unclear**: Despite chip restrictions, China continues rapid capability improvement

This complicates the "data centre capacity as proxy for AI power" thesis. Raw compute may matter less than algorithmic efficiency and deployment scale.

## The Asian Advantage

### Why China Leads in Optimism
- 93% of Chinese employees use AI for work (KPMG 2025)—far above 58% global average
- Economic transformation powered by successive technology waves (mobile payments, HSR, EVs)
- Each wave delivered visible benefits to ordinary citizens
- Less resistance to data collection and algorithmic decision-making
- Collectivist orientation accepts what individualist cultures frame as privacy violations

### Japan: The Cautious Exception
- Lowest AI adoption in Asia-Pacific (51-56%)
- Only 13.6% of AI users deploy daily; 34.6% several times weekly
- Workplace GenAI usage: 19.2% active users (Feb 2025)
- Reflects traditional cautious approach—thorough evaluation before implementation
- AI market still projected to grow from $15.6B (2025) to $123.9B (2032)

## AI Workforce Impact

### Employee AI Usage (2025 surveys)
| Country | Employees using AI at work |
|---------|---------------------------|
| China | 93% |
| Global average | 58% |
| Japan | 36.9% (inc. occasional) |

### Job Displacement Projections (Institutional Consensus)

| Source | Jobs Displaced | Jobs Created | Net | Notes |
|--------|----------------|--------------|-----|-------|
| WEF 2025 | 92M by 2030 | 170M | +78M | Assumes retraining works |
| Goldman Sachs | 6-7% of US workforce | Offsetting | Transitory | Baseline scenario |

**Additional institutional projections**:
- 30% of US jobs could be fully automated by 2030
- 60% will see significant task-level changes
- 79% of employed women in US work in high-automation-risk jobs vs 58% of men

**See [AI Displacement](../trends/ai-displacement.md) for analytical critique of these projections.**
