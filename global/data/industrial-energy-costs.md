- **Venezuela**: $0.01-0.05/kWh — Subsidized but grid collapse negates advantage

## AI Infrastructure Competitiveness Tiers

Based on energy costs alone (excluding other factors like talent, regulatory environment, grid reliability):

| Tier | Countries | Energy Cost Range | Assessment |
|------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| **Strong Advantage** | US, China, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Malaysia, Vietnam, Canada (Quebec), Australia (large) | <$0.08/kWh | Structural advantage for compute-intensive operations |
| **Competitive** | India, South Korea, France, Poland, Taiwan, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Mexico | $0.08-0.15/kWh | Viable with other advantages |
| **Disadvantaged** | Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Philippines, UK | $0.15-0.30/kWh | Requires subsidies or niche positioning; UK highest in Europe |

## Key Trends (2024-2025)

1. **EU-US Gap Persists**: European industrial prices remain 2-4x US levels despite post-crisis normalization
2. **China Closing Gap**: Chinese industrial rates rising toward $0.10/kWh but still competitive
3. **Middle East Buildout**: Saudi Arabia and UAE leveraging energy advantage for AI infrastructure
4. **ASEAN Divergence**: Malaysia/Vietnam pulling ahead; Philippines falling behind
5. **UK Crisis**: Highest industrial rates in Europe (89% above EU14 median); energy-intensive industries down 33% since 2021

## Caveats

- **Grid Reliability**: Nigeria, South Africa, Venezuela, Pakistan have low nominal rates but unreliable grids add hidden costs (generators, backup systems)
- **Regional Variation**: Large countries (US, Canada, China, Australia) have significant internal variation
- **Subsidies**: Many low-rate countries (Iran, Venezuela, Argentina, Egypt) maintain rates through subsidies that may not persist
- **Exchange Rates**: USD conversions fluctuate; local currency stability matters
- **Large vs. SME**: Industrial rates for large consumers often 50-70% lower than SME rates (Australia exemplifies this)
