# Global Overview: 2026-2036

A synthesis of worldwide trends, data, and analysis shaping the coming decade.

## The Transformation Underway

The forces now in motion—artificial intelligence, demographic transformation, energy realignment, and the erosion of institutional legitimacy—represent a phase transition in the organisation of human societies. This is not incremental change but discontinuous transformation, comparable in scale to industrialisation but compressed into a fraction of the time.

The central dynamic: **AI-driven displacement** at approximately 5% of jobs per year, reaching ~50% cumulative displacement by 2035. A second wave of **physical automation** through humanoid robotics accelerates after 2030. Together, these waves close the traditional escape valve of retraining for different work.

Nations divide into those that **own AI systems and possess energy to power them** (capturing enormous gains) versus those that **provide services to the global economy** (watching their comparative advantage evaporate). A critical variable is **cultural and regulatory disposition toward adoption**—resistance through regulation does not prevent AI deployment, it merely determines whether gains are captured domestically or by competitors.

## Key Metrics Summary (December 2025)

### Data Center Capacity

| Leader | Capacity | Share | 2030 Projection |
|--------|----------|-------|-----------------|
| United States | 53.7 GW | 44% of global | 132 GW |
| China | 31.9 GW | 26% (but 80% of new capacity idle) | 50+ GW |
| European Union | 11.9 GW | 10% | 41 GW |

**Stargate Project** (announced Jan 2025): $500 billion commitment, ~7 GW planned across 6 sites. Experienced mid-2025 delays (Bloomberg: "no funds raised") but recovered September 2025 with $400B committed and back on track for 10 GW. Abilene flagship operational.

### AI Investment Gap (2024)

| Metric | US | China | Gap |
|--------|-----|-------|-----|
| Private AI investment | $109.1B | $9.3B | **12x** |
| Generative AI investment | $33.9B | ~$3B | **11x** |
| Cumulative 2013-2024 | $470B | ~$50B | **9x** |
| Notable AI models (2024) | 40 | 15 | **2.7x** |

**Critical caveat (DeepSeek disruption)**: Despite 12x investment gap, Chinese models achieved near-parity on benchmarks by end 2024 (Stanford HAI: 0.3% gap on MMLU). DeepSeek-V3/R1 trained at 1/100th cost of US models. Investment may not equal capability.

### AI Adoption Reality (Dec 2025)

The adoption picture is more nuanced than simple percentages suggest:

| Metric | Rate | Source |
|--------|------|--------|
| Organizations using AI in any function | 88% | McKinsey Nov 2025 |
| "High performers" capturing real value | **6%** | McKinsey Nov 2025 |
| US businesses with meaningful AI use | 9.7% | US Census Aug 2025 |
| Chinese employees using AI at work | 93% | KPMG 2025 |

**Key insight**: 88% are experimenting; only 6% are transforming. The gap between experimentation and operational deployment determines who captures value.

### Humanoid Robotics (2025 Status)

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Tesla Optimus Gen 3 | Unveiled Oct 2025; autonomous learning demonstrated |
| Tesla production reality | Target 5,000 by end 2025; actual "hundreds" (mid-2025) — **significant shortfall** |
| BYD | 1,500 in 2025; 20,000 target by 2026; on track |
| Unitree R1 | **$5,900 price point** (July 2025) — potential game-changer |
| Commercial deployment | Digit (GXO/Amazon), Figure AI (BMW) |
| Market projections 2035 | $6B–$180B (30x analyst variance) |

**Assessment**: Demonstrations impressive; Western production behind schedule. Chinese manufacturers may lead on deployment via price advantage.

### Country Outlook Summary

*Note: GDP ranges are decade trajectories (2026-2036), not annual rates.*

| Outlook | Countries | Decade Trajectory | Confidence |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Winner | US, China, Australia, Poland, Vietnam, Indonesia, UAE | +30% to +80% | High-Moderate |
| Restructured | Canada | +20% to +40% (concentrated) | Moderate |
| Survivor | Singapore, Japan, South Korea | +10% to +40% | Moderate-High |
| Declining | Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Russia | -5% to -30% | High-Moderate |
| Contested | Ireland, Turkey, Thailand | -15% to +30% | Low |
| Fracturing | UK, France | -15% to -40% | Moderate |
| Collapsing | Iran, Venezuela | Severe | High |
