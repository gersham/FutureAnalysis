# Global Overview: 2026-2036

A synthesis of worldwide trends, data, and analysis shaping the coming decade.

## The Transformation Underway

The forces now in motion—artificial intelligence, demographic transformation, energy realignment, and the erosion of institutional legitimacy—represent a phase transition in the organisation of human societies. This is not incremental change but discontinuous transformation, comparable in scale to industrialisation but compressed into a fraction of the time.

The central dynamic: **AI‑driven displacement** at approximately 5% of jobs per year, reaching on the order of half (~40–45%) cumulative displacement by the mid‑2030s. A second wave of **physical automation** through humanoid robotics accelerates after 2030. Together, these waves close the traditional escape valve of retraining for different work.

Nations divide into those that **own AI systems and possess energy to power them** (capturing gains) versus those that **provide services to the global economy** (watching comparative advantage erode). Crucially, compute/energy are part of a broader **factor bundle**—regulation, capital markets, talent, and cultural adoption (see [Methodology](../METHODOLOGY.md)) materially shift outcomes. Resistance through regulation does not prevent AI deployment; it primarily influences where value is captured.

## Data

Current known facts and metrics.

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| [Data Center Capacity](data/data-center-capacity.md) | Installed GW by country, 2030 projections, energy costs |
| [AI Adoption Rates](data/ai-adoption-rates.md) | Organizational adoption and citizen optimism by country |
| [Robotics Deployment](data/robotics-deployment.md) | Current pilots, technical parameters, market projections |

---

## Trends

Observable patterns in motion.

| Trend | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| [AI Displacement](trends/ai-displacement.md) | ~5% of jobs annually; white-collar, professional, entry-level hit first |
| [Robotics Wave](trends/robotics-wave.md) | Physical automation scales 2027-2030; service sector by 2035 |
| [Energy & Data Centers](trends/energy-and-data-centers.md) | Computational capacity as new oil; US dominant, Europe trailing |
| [Cultural Adoption](trends/cultural-adoption.md) | Asian advantage; American paradox; stringent EU‑style regulation imposes costs |
| [Financial Services Disruption](trends/financial-services-disruption.md) | AI + alternative finance hollowing traditional hubs |
| [Legitimacy Crisis](trends/legitimacy-crisis.md) | Pre-existing trust deficits compound economic shock |

## Analysis

Suppositions and predictions based on data and trends.

| Analysis | Summary |
|----------|---------|
| [Winners and Losers](analysis/winners-and-losers.md) | Framework and country classifications |
| [Alternative Scenarios](analysis/alternative-scenarios.md) | **NEW**: Stress-testing the thesis; AI winter, Taiwan, DeepSeek paradigm |
| [Actionable Implications](analysis/actionable-implications.md) | What to do based on this analysis |
| [View from 2036](analysis/view-from-2036.md) | Projected end-state of the transformation |

## Cross-Country Linkages

This scenario is explicitly global: downturns and gains in one place show up as flows elsewhere.

- **Labour flows**: High-skill workers leaving [Fracturing](analysis/winners-and-losers.md) economies (UK, France) tend to land in "Winner" and "Survivor" hubs (US, Canada, Australia, Singapore), reinforcing divergence.
- **Capital flows**: Capital leaving structurally **Declining** Europe (Germany, Switzerland, Italy) seeks returns in energy- and AI‑infrastructure plays (US, Gulf states, Australia, Indonesia).
- **Supply chains**: AI-enabled reshoring and "friend‑shoring" redirect manufacturing and services from China and vulnerable hubs toward "swing" countries (Vietnam, India, Mexico, Poland, Indonesia).
- **Compute flows**: Nations with weak domestic data‑centre economics (UK, much of EU) increasingly rent capacity from US or Gulf‑hosted infrastructure, importing capability but exporting a share of value.

These flows link country-level stories into one system: distress in service-heavy, high-cost economies is the mechanism by which winners and survivors consolidate their position in the 5%‑displacement world.

## Regional Trajectories

| Region | Trajectory | Countries |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| [North America](../regions/north-america/) | Divergent: US dominance, Canadian restructuring | US, Canada |
| [Europe](../regions/europe/) | Regulatory burden, energy crisis, fracturing | UK, Germany, France, Poland, Ireland, Switzerland |
| [Asia-Pacific](../regions/asia-pacific/) | Adoption advantage, varied outcomes | China, Japan, Singapore, Australia |

## Key Metrics Summary (December 2025)

### Data Center Capacity

See canonical figures and projections in [Global Data: Data Center Capacity](data/data-center-capacity.md). Headline: the United States leads by a wide margin; Europe trails on both cost and capacity; US+China account for the majority of global capacity.

### AI Investment Gap (2024)

| Metric | US | China | Gap |
|--------|-----|-------|-----|
| Private AI investment | $109.1B | $9.3B | **12x** |
| Generative AI investment | $33.9B | ~$3B | **11x** |
| Cumulative 2013-2024 | $470B | ~$50B | **9x** |
| Notable AI models (2024) | 40 | 15 | **2.7x** |

**Critical caveat (DeepSeek disruption)**: Despite 12x investment gap, Chinese models achieved near-parity on benchmarks by end 2024 (Stanford HAI: 0.3% gap on MMLU). DeepSeek-V3/R1 trained at 1/100th cost of US models. Investment may not equal capability.

### AI Adoption Reality (Dec 2025)

The adoption picture is more nuanced than simple percentages suggest:

| Metric | Rate | Source |
|--------|------|--------|
| Organizations using AI in any function | 88% | McKinsey Nov 2025 |
| "High performers" capturing real value | **6%** | McKinsey Nov 2025 |
| US businesses with meaningful AI use | 9.7% | US Census Aug 2025 |
| Chinese employees using AI at work | 93% | KPMG 2025 |

**Key insight**: 88% are experimenting; only 6% are transforming. The gap between experimentation and operational deployment determines who captures value.

### Humanoid Robotics (2025 Status)

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Tesla Optimus Gen 3 | Unveiled Oct 2025; autonomous learning demonstrated |
| Tesla production reality | Target 5,000 by end 2025; actual "hundreds" (mid-2025) — **significant shortfall** |
| BYD | 1,500 in 2025; 20,000 target by 2026; on track |
| Unitree R1 | **$5,900 price point** (July 2025) — potential game-changer |
| Commercial deployment | Digit (GXO/Amazon), Figure AI (BMW) |
| Market projections 2035 | $6B–$180B (30x analyst variance) |

**Assessment**: Demonstrations impressive; Western production behind schedule. Chinese manufacturers may lead on deployment via price advantage.

### Country Outlook Summary

Qualitative growth outlooks within the 5%/year displacement scenario.

| Outlook | Countries | Growth Outlook | Confidence |
|---------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| Winner | US, China, Australia, Poland, UAE | High | Moderate‑High |
| Restructured | Canada | Moderate (Uneven/Concentrated) | Moderate |
| Survivor | Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia | Moderate | Moderate‑High |
| Declining | Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Russia | Low/Negative | Moderate‑High |
| Contested | Ireland, Turkey, Thailand, Vietnam | Uncertain (High variance) | Low‑Moderate |
| Fracturing | UK, France | Negative with instability risk | Moderate |
| Collapsing | Iran, Venezuela | Severe contraction | High |

See [Winners and Losers](analysis/winners-and-losers.md) for full framework and [Alternative Scenarios](analysis/alternative-scenarios.md) for conditions under which these outlooks would change.
