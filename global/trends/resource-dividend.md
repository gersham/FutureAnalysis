# The Resource Dividend: Resources for Compute

As AI-powered economies accelerate, they consume more of everything: energy, metals, food, water. The productivity gains from automation do not reduce material consumption—they increase it. Wealthier societies consume more. Faster-growing economies build more infrastructure. AI data centres alone require enormous quantities of copper, rare earths, lithium, and other critical minerals. The semiconductor fabs that produce AI chips are among the most resource-intensive facilities ever built.

This creates a second-order effect that benefits resource-rich nations even if they capture none of the first-order AI gains. Countries that possess natural resources—energy, critical minerals, agricultural capacity—will see demand for their exports increase as AI-adopting economies grow faster and consume more. The resource dividend flows to nations that control what AI-era economies need to function.

## Beneficiaries of the Resource Dividend

| Country | Key Resources | Second-Order Effect |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Australia** | Critical minerals (lithium, rare earths, copper, nickel, cobalt), uranium, LNG, iron ore | Direct supplier to AI hardware manufacturing and energy transition |
| **Canada** | Hydroelectric power, natural gas, critical minerals, uranium, potash | Energy exports and critical minerals feed US AI infrastructure |
| **Russia** | Oil, gas, metals, agricultural land | Sanctions limit Western access but Asian demand persists |
| **Saudi Arabia/UAE** | Oil, gas, sovereign capital | Converting resource wealth to AI infrastructure directly |
| **Indonesia** | Nickel (40% of global reserves), copper, palm oil, coal | Critical for EV batteries and electronics manufacturing |
| **Brazil** | Iron ore, agricultural commodities, lithium, niobium (90%+ global) | Commodity exports benefit from global AI-driven growth |
| **Chile** | Copper (25%+ of global production), lithium | Essential for electrical infrastructure and batteries |

## Two Channels of the Resource Dividend

### 1. Direct AI Infrastructure Demand

Data centres, semiconductors, and AI hardware require:
- **Copper** for wiring and power transmission
- **Rare earths** for magnets in drives and motors
- **Lithium** for batteries and energy storage
- **Silicon** for chips
- **Nickel and cobalt** for batteries
- **Aluminum** for heat dissipation and structures

As AI deployment scales, demand for these inputs scales with it. A single large data centre requires thousands of tonnes of copper. TSMC's Arizona fab consumes resources comparable to a small city.

### 2. Indirect Consumption Growth

AI-accelerated economies grow faster. Growing economies:
- Consume more energy
- Build more infrastructure
- Demand more agricultural output
- Expand housing and construction

Resource exporters benefit whether or not they adopt AI themselves. When the US economy grows 4% instead of 2% because of AI productivity gains, it consumes more Brazilian iron ore, more Australian coal, more Canadian natural gas. The resource dividend operates through the consumption patterns of AI-adopting economies, not through the resource exporters' own AI deployment.

## The New Petrodollar: Resources for Compute

The emerging pattern echoes the petrodollar system that shaped the late twentieth century. From the 1970s onward, oil was priced in dollars, creating circular dependency:

1. Oil exports generated dollar reserves
2. Dollar demand sustained US financial hegemony
3. The US provided security guarantees to oil producers
4. Oil continued flowing and continued being priced in dollars

Resource-rich nations traded hydrocarbons for access to the dollar-denominated financial system.

The AI era is creating an analogous structure: **resources for compute**. Nations that possess energy, critical minerals, and agricultural capacity can trade these for access to AI infrastructure and the productivity gains it enables. The currency is no longer just dollars—it is compute capacity, AI model access, and integration into the supply chains that produce intelligence.

| Petrodollar Era | Compute Era |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Oil priced in dollars | AI infrastructure requires resources |
| Dollar reserves = financial access | Compute access = productivity gains |
| US security guarantees for producers | US/China tech relationships for suppliers |
| OPEC as coordinating mechanism | Bilateral resource-for-infrastructure deals |

The Gulf states understand this shift explicitly. Saudi Arabia's $100 billion Project Transcendence and UAE's $1.4 trillion US investment framework are not merely diversification plays—they are exchanges of hydrocarbon wealth for compute infrastructure.

---

## Asymmetric Leverage: Why This Is Not the Petrodollar

The critical difference from the petrodollar era is **asymmetric leverage**. The petrodollar system created mutual dependency: the US needed oil as much as producers needed dollars. The OPEC embargo of 1973 demonstrated that resource providers had real power to disrupt the system.

The resources-for-compute exchange is fundamentally lopsided:

| Dimension | Resources | Compute |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Fungibility** | High—commodities trade globally | Low—specific infrastructure, specific relationships |
| **Switching cost** | Low—find another buyer | High—rebuild entire AI stack |
| **Concentration** | Distributed across many nations | Concentrated in US and China |
| **Revocability** | Hard to embargo (commodities flow) | Easy—adjust access, throttle API, sanction chips |
| **Visibility** | Physical, trackable | Digital, can be modified invisibly |

### The Leverage Flows Toward Compute Holders

Australia can sell iron ore to China if the US relationship sours. But if the US revokes compute access—cuts off cloud services, restricts AI model access, sanctions chip exports—there is no alternative supplier at comparable capability. China offers a partial alternative, but choosing the Chinese compute ecosystem means alignment with Chinese interests and exclusion from American technology.

This asymmetry creates **stronger alignment pressure** than the petrodollar system ever did. Resource-rich nations seeking compute access must maintain relationships with compute holders on the compute holders' terms. The data centres are in Virginia, Texas, Oregon—or Guizhou and Inner Mongolia. The leverage flows toward those locations, not away from them.

### Sovereignty Projects

Saudi Arabia and UAE understand this implicitly. Their massive AI investments are not merely diversification—they are attempts to build domestic compute capacity precisely because depending on American or Chinese infrastructure means depending on American or Chinese goodwill. The $100 billion Project Transcendence and the Abu Dhabi Stargate cluster are sovereignty projects as much as economic ones.

For nations without sovereign wealth to build domestic compute infrastructure, the choice is starker: **align with a compute hegemon or accept exclusion from AI productivity gains**. This is a more coercive structure than the petrodollar system, where oil revenues at least provided leverage. In the compute era, the resource providers need the compute holders more than the compute holders need any individual resource provider.

## The Resource Curse in the Compute Era

The resource curse—the historical pattern of resource-dependent economies failing to develop—remains a risk. But in the AI era, the relevant question is not whether resource dependency limits development; it is whether resource revenues can be converted into compute access and AI productivity gains.

**Success cases**: Australia, Canada, and the Gulf states have the governance capacity and strategic positioning to execute the exchange. They can convert resource revenues into compute relationships, infrastructure investment, and productivity gains.

**Failure cases**: Nigeria, where resource revenues accrue to the state rather than the population and where governance failures prevent effective conversion to productive assets, gains less from the resource dividend. Having resources is necessary but not sufficient.

The determining factor is **conversion capacity**: the ability to trade resources for compute access and distribute the resulting gains throughout the economy.

## Implications

### For Resource-Rich Nations

1. **Align strategically**: Choose compute relationships carefully—US vs China alignment has long-term consequences
2. **Build domestic capacity where possible**: Sovereign compute reduces dependency (Gulf model)
3. **Focus on conversion**: Resource revenues must translate to compute access and productivity gains, not just extraction income
4. **Diversify within alignment**: Multiple relationships within a bloc provide some insurance

### For Compute Holders (US, China)

1. **Resource relationships become strategic**: Critical mineral access matters for AI supply chains
2. **Compute access is leverage**: Can be used to shape alignment and behaviour
3. **Competition for resources**: US-China competition extends to resource-rich nations
4. **Infrastructure as foreign policy**: Data centre investment is geopolitical positioning

### For Nations Without Resources or Compute

The hardest position. Must provide something else of value—labour, location, market access—to participate in AI productivity gains. Risk of permanent exclusion from the AI dividend if unable to establish valuable relationships with compute holders.
