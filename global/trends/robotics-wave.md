# Robotics Wave (Second Wave Automation)

> **Timeframe**: 2027-2035+
> **Nature**: Physical automation through humanoid robotics
> **Sequence**: Automotive → Logistics → Warehousing → Service

## Overview

The first wave of AI automation (2023-2030) primarily affects cognitive and administrative work. A second wave is building: physical automation through humanoid robotics and advanced manufacturing systems.

This wave is **rear-weighted** toward the latter half of the decade and into the 2030s, but foundations are being laid now.

## Timeline

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 2025 | Hundreds deployed in pilot programmes |
| 2027-2028 | Inflection point: pilots → large-scale deployment |
| 2030 | 6-hour battery life; automotive/logistics mainstream |
| 2035 | $30-80B market; service sector expansion |
| 2035+ | Full 8-hour shifts may require another decade |

## Technical Trajectory

### Battery Life
| Year | Duration |
|------|----------|
| 2025 | ~2 hours |
| 2030 | ~6 hours |
| 2035+ | 8 hours (full shift) |

### Current Limitations (2025)
- Battery life requires frequent recharging
- Limited dexterity for complex manipulation
- Safety constraints require semi-segregated operating areas
- Production at pilot scale, not mass deployment

## Sector Adoption Sequence

### Phase 1: Automotive Manufacturing (Now - 2028)
- Intrafactory logistics
- Assembly assistance
- First sector for large-scale deployment

### Phase 2: Logistics and Warehousing (2027-2030)
- Warehouse operations
- Distribution centres
- Package handling

### Phase 3: Service Sectors (2030+)
- Retail
- Hospitality
- Healthcare assistance
- General service roles

## Implication: Compounding Displacement

The robotics wave compounds the AI displacement crisis:

1. Workers displaced from white-collar jobs (2025-2030) might seek manual labour
2. But manual labour faces its own automation (2030-2035)
3. The traditional escape valve—retraining for different work—closes
4. Both cognitive AND physical work face automation pressure simultaneously

## Key Players

- **Figure AI** - Humanoid robotics for industrial applications
- **Agility Robotics** - Digit platform for warehousing
- **Tesla** - Optimus development
- **BYD** - Scaling production for manufacturing
