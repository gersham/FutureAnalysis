# AI Displacement Wave

> **Rate**: ~5% net job displacement per year (beginning 2026)
> **Cumulative**: On the order of half (~40–45%) of current employment displaced/reshaped by mid‑2030s
> **Timeframe**: 2026-2036
> **Confidence**: Moderate‑High (as scenario premise)

## Analytical Note on Projections

Institutional projections (WEF, Goldman Sachs, McKinsey) consistently forecast modest displacement with offsetting job creation. These projections deserve scrutiny:

- **Goldman Sachs (2025)**: 6-7% total displacement, "transitory" impact, new jobs emerge
- **WEF (2025)**: 92M jobs displaced, 170M created (net +78M by 2030)
- **McKinsey (2025)**: 88% of orgs experimenting, only 6% capturing real value

These projections share a common bias: they extrapolate from historical automation waves where cognitive work was the escape valve. They assume the pattern holds—that displaced workers retrain for "AI-adjacent" roles (prompt engineers, AI ethics officers, human-AI collaboration specialists).

This analysis rejects that assumption. The 5% annual rate reflects:
1. **Capability trajectory**: Models improving faster than institutional adoption cycles
2. **Cost arbitrage**: 10-100x cost reductions make delay economically irrational
3. **Competitive dynamics**: Once leaders adopt, laggards face extinction
4. **No cognitive refuge**: Unlike previous waves, AI targets cognitive work directly

The institutional consensus that "new jobs emerge" is not a finding—it is an assumption baked into models designed to avoid panic. The 5% figure is a structural forecast, not a consensus estimate.

## The Pattern Break

Previous automation waves followed a predictable pattern: machines replaced physical labour while creating new demand for cognitive work. The factory displaced the artisan; the spreadsheet displaced the bookkeeper; each transition created more jobs than it destroyed.

The implicit promise was that education and retraining could always stay ahead of the machines—that human cognitive flexibility would remain the irreducible advantage.

**Artificial intelligence breaks this pattern.**

Large language models and their successors are general-purpose cognitive tools capable of performing tasks across domains that previously required years of specialised training. Legal research, medical diagnosis, financial analysis, software development, marketing copy, administrative coordination—the entire edifice of the knowledge economy rests on tasks that AI systems can now perform at or above human level, at a fraction of the cost, with infinite scalability.

## Who Gets Displaced

### By Role Type
- White-collar and professional roles
- Administrative and coordination functions
- Junior and entry-level positions
- Part-time work

### By Demographics
- Disproportionate impact on women (administrative roles)
- Disproportionate impact on younger workers (entry-level)
- Professional-managerial class most exposed

### By Sector
- Financial services (information processing)
- Legal services (research, document review)
- Healthcare administration
- Marketing and communications
- Software development (junior roles)
- Customer service
- HR functions

## The Economics

The arithmetic is stark:
- A junior lawyer billing hundreds of dollars per hour → replaced by system costing pennies per query
- A team of analysts producing quarterly reports → reduced to one person prompting an AI
- Customer service department, HR function, marketing team, paralegal pool → compressed by order of magnitude

The pressure on firms is existential, not ideological:
- First mover gains insurmountable cost advantage
- Laggard goes bankrupt
- No firm can afford to forgo these gains if competitors adopt

## Timeline

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 2023-2025 | Capability demonstration; early enterprise adoption |
| 2025-2027 | Acceleration in knowledge work; displacement becomes visible |
| 2027-2030 | First wave peaks; major employment disruption |
| 2030-2035 | Second wave (robotics) begins; physical automation accelerates |

## The Escape Valve Closes

Traditionally, workers displaced from higher-skill roles could retrain for different work. The AI transition closes this escape valve:

1. **White-collar displaced 2025-2030** cannot simply retrain for blue-collar work
2. **Robotics wave 2030-2035** automates the blue-collar jobs they might have sought
3. The traditional pathway—moving down the skill ladder—closes just as it's needed most

## Early Signals

Observable displacement is already underway in the baseline period (2024-2025):

| Metric | Trend | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Tech layoffs | **Elevated**; shifting from growth to efficiency | Industry trackers |
| Job market | **Softening** for junior/entry-level roles | Federal Reserve / Central Banks |
| Youth unemployment | **Rising** in tech-exposed cohorts | National Statistics |
| Sector impact | **High** in coding/customer service roles | Recruitment platforms |

*See [Current Indicators](../data/current-indicators.md) for specific tracking data.*

These are leading indicators. The 5% annual rate assumes acceleration as:
- Enterprise deployments move from pilot to production
- Cost curves continue declining
- Competitive pressure intensifies
- Second-order effects (reduced consumer spending) compound

## Falsifiable Criteria

This projection would be falsified if by end of 2027:
- Overall unemployment remains below 6% in US/UK
- Knowledge worker employment (NAICS 54) grows year-over-year
- AI adoption stalls below 50% of enterprises at production scale
- Wage growth in exposed sectors exceeds inflation
