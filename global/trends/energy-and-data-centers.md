# Energy and Data Centers: The New Oil

> **Core thesis**: Data centre capacity is the critical resource upon which 21st-century economic power depends
> **Parallel**: Just as 20th-century geopolitics revolved around petroleum, 21st-century power flows from computational infrastructure

## The New Resource Competition

Intelligence, in its artificial form, is **electricity transformed through silicon**. Nations that can provide abundant, reliable, affordable power for data centres will capture AI productivity gains. Those that cannot will import their intelligence at whatever price the market demands—and find themselves in a new form of colonial dependency.

## Current Distribution (2025)

The distribution of computational infrastructure is already starkly unequal:

| Position | Countries |
|----------|-----------|
| **Dominant** | United States (53.7 GW, 44% of global) |
| **Major Power** | China (~32 GW) |
| **Trailing** | European Union (11.9 GW total) |
| **Constrained** | Japan, UK, Germany (1-1.5 GW each) |
| **Rising** | Australia (1.3 GW, expanding) |

## The American Advantage

US infrastructure expansion is industrial-scale:
- Virginia alone: 12+ GW installed, expanding rapidly
- Stargate project: 10 GW of AI-dedicated infrastructure planned
- 55+ GW additional capacity expected by 2030
- Total by 2030: 81+ GW

This is not incremental addition—it represents construction of industrial infrastructure on a scale not seen since early 20th-century electrification.

## European Constraints

Europe is falling behind due to structural limitations:

### Energy Costs
- Germany electricity costs: 3-4x US levels
- Makes data centre operations fundamentally uncompetitive

### Grid Constraints
- Dublin at grid capacity, facing moratoriums on new connections
- Frankfurt hub hamstrung by energy prices

### Land and Power
- London lacks both cheap power and expansion land
- Dense urban centres poorly suited for data centre scale-up

## Implications

### For AI-Capturing Nations
- Abundant, cheap energy → data centre expansion → AI deployment → productivity gains → wealth creation

### For AI-Importing Nations
- Energy constraints → limited infrastructure → dependency on foreign AI services → wealth extraction
- New form of colonial relationship: exporting data, importing intelligence

### Energy as Strategic Asset
Nations with:
- Hydroelectric power (Canada, Norway)
- Natural gas (US, Australia)
- Nuclear capacity (France—if deployable)
- Solar potential at scale (Australia)

...have strategic advantages that may offset other weaknesses.
