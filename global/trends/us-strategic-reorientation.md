# US Strategic Reorientation

## Status: Emerging Signal (December 2025)

The December 2025 US National Security Strategy and associated reporting suggest a potential shift in American grand strategy away from post-Cold War alliance leadership toward a spheres-of-influence framework. This remains unconfirmed but represents a checkpoint worth tracking.

**Confidence level**: Low-Moderate. The published NSS contains explicit spheres-of-influence language. The more radical proposals (C5 framework) come from leaked documents the White House has denied.

## What the Published NSS Says

The December 4, 2025 National Security Strategy (33 pages, publicly available) contains:

- **Explicit spheres-of-influence framing**: "The outsized influence of larger, richer, and stronger nations" is "a timeless truth of international relations"
- **Rejection of hegemony**: US will "reject the ill-fated concept of global domination" in favour of "global and regional balances of power"
- **Europe as secondary**: Dedicated section on "Promoting European Greatness" frames Europe's problems as "deeper than insufficient military spending"—including "civilizational" concerns
- **Regional champions**: Proposes rewarding nations that "take more responsibility for security in their neighborhoods"

## What the Leaked Version Reportedly Contains

Defense One reported (December 9, 2025) that a longer classified version circulating in Washington proposes:

- **"Core 5" (C5)**: New top-tier governance forum comprising US, China, Russia, India, Japan
- **Selection criteria**: Population >100 million + major power status (not democracy or wealth)
- **Purpose**: Function like G7 but without democratic/economic prerequisites
- **First agenda**: Israel-Saudi normalisation
- **Philosophy**: "Hegemony is the wrong thing to want and it wasn't achievable"

**White House response**: Officials denied the leaked version's authenticity, claiming only the published NSS represents official policy.

## If True, What Changes

### For Europe

| Current Assumption | Potential Shift |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| US commitment wavering but salvageable | US actively deprioritising Europe |
| NATO Article 5 remains credible | Security umbrella explicitly conditional |
| G7 membership = top-tier status | Europe excluded from top-tier governance (C5) |
| Transatlantic relationship strained | "Transatlantic relationship as we know it is over" (ECFR) |

### For the Winners/Losers Framework

| Country/Region | Implication |
|----------------|-------------|
| **India** | Elevated to top-tier peer status; validates "Contested → Winner" trajectory |
| **Japan** | Elevated; but also expected to carry regional defence burden |
| **Russia** | Potentially rehabilitated as legitimate sphere-holder |
| **China** | Recognised as peer competitor with legitimate sphere |
| **Europe** | Demoted from ally to "sphere" expected to manage own security |
| **Poland** | Bilateral US strategy potentially validated over EU integration |

## Tracking Indicators

To confirm or disconfirm this trajectory, watch for:

**Confirming signals**:
- C5 or similar forum announced
- US-Russia bilateral engagement on spheres (Ukraine settlement with territorial recognition)
- NATO burden-sharing demands escalate beyond 5% rhetoric
- US reduces Europe troop presence or pre-positioned equipment
- G7 summits deprioritised or restructured

**Disconfirming signals**:
- NSS walked back or superseded
- NATO reaffirmation with concrete commitments
- C5 concept abandoned
- European security guarantees strengthened
- Leaked version confirmed as non-authoritative

## Assessment

This analysis has projected European decline and US security umbrella fraying since inception. The December 2025 NSS represents a potential **first checkpoint validating that thesis**—but at the rhetorical/signalling level, not yet at the policy-implementation level.

The difference between "US commitment wavering" and "US explicitly adopting spheres-of-influence" is significant:
- Wavering implies Europeans can pull Americans back with sufficient effort
- Spheres-of-influence implies a strategic choice, not a drift to be reversed

If the spheres framework represents actual US strategic thinking, the timeline for European adjustment compresses. The luxury of hoping for American return disappears.

**Current assessment**: Treat as significant signal, not confirmed pivot. The published NSS language is real and concerning. The C5 proposal specifically remains unverified. Upgrade confidence if confirming signals emerge in Q1-Q2 2026.
