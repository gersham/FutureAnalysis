## What This Is

This is a **scenario exercise, not a forecast**. The core premise: assume ~5% net job displacement per year from 2026 to 2036 and follow the consequences. Country classifications represent central cases with significant variance.

The confident prose is rhetorical—useful for thinking through implications, but not a claim to know the future.
