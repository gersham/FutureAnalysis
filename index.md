# The Fracturing

*Western Civilisation and the Coming Decade of Transformation, 2026–2036*

---

> *Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;*
> *Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.*
>
> — W.B. Yeats, "The Second Coming"

---

> **Epistemic Status**: This is a scenario exercise, not a forecast. The confident prose is rhetorical—useful for thinking through implications, but not a claim to know the future. The core premise is simple: assume ~5% net job displacement per year from 2026 to 2036 and follow the consequences. Country classifications represent central cases with significant variance. See [Methodology](METHODOLOGY.md) for explicit assumptions, model structure, and what would change our mind.

## Introduction: The Shape of What Is Coming

The next decade will not be a continuation of the last. The forces now in motion—artificial intelligence, demographic transformation, energy realignment, and the erosion of institutional legitimacy—are not merely trends to be managed. They represent a phase transition in the organisation of human societies, comparable in scale to industrialisation but compressed into a fraction of the time. By 2036, the political, economic, and social landscape of the Western world will be unrecognisable to those who remember 2020.

This analysis proceeds from a specific analytical assumption: that artificial intelligence will displace approximately five percent of existing jobs per year on a net basis over the coming decade, such that on the order of half of current employment is displaced or transformed by 2036. The displacement will concentrate in white-collar, professional, and administrative roles; in junior and entry-level positions; in part-time work; and disproportionately in sectors dominated by women and younger workers. A second wave of physical automation—humanoid robotics and advanced manufacturing systems—will begin to accelerate after 2030, eventually reaching blue-collar and service work that the first wave spared.

Within this framework, we can identify a clear division emerging among nations. Those that own the artificial intelligence systems, possess abundant energy to power them, and control natural resources will capture enormous gains. Those that provide services to the global economy—financial intermediation, professional consultancy, administrative processing—will find their comparative advantage evaporating. And those that combine economic disruption with pre-existing social fractures may face outcomes considerably worse than mere recession.

A critical variable will be cultural and regulatory disposition toward adoption. Nations that embrace AI aggressively will capture productivity gains; those that resist through regulation, litigation, or cultural aversion will fall behind—and their resistance will not prevent the technology from being deployed against them by competitors. The regulatory impulse, strongest in Europe but spreading to Canada and Australia, risks redistributing gains abroad if compliance burdens significantly slow domestic deployment.

## Part I: The Great Displacement

*Derived from: [AI Displacement](global/trends/ai-displacement.md) | [Robotics Wave](global/trends/robotics-wave.md)*

### The Nature of AI Automation

Previous waves of automation followed a predictable pattern: machines replaced physical labour while creating new demand for cognitive work. The factory displaced the artisan; the spreadsheet displaced the bookkeeper; each transition created more jobs than it destroyed, albeit with painful adjustments in between. The implicit promise was that education and retraining could always stay ahead of the machines—that human cognitive flexibility would remain the irreducible advantage.

Artificial intelligence breaks this pattern. Large language models and their successors are not merely faster calculators; they are general-purpose cognitive tools capable of performing tasks across domains that previously required years of specialised training. Legal research, medical diagnosis, financial analysis, software development, marketing copy, administrative coordination—the entire edifice of the knowledge economy rests on tasks that AI systems can now perform at or above human level, at a fraction of the cost, with infinite scalability.

The arithmetic is stark. A junior lawyer billing at several hundred dollars per hour can be replaced by a system costing pennies per query. A team of analysts producing quarterly reports can be reduced to one person prompting an AI. The customer service department, the HR function, the marketing team, the paralegal pool—each represents a cost centre that artificial intelligence can compress by an order of magnitude. The pressure on firms to adopt these technologies is not ideological but existential: the first mover gains an insurmountable cost advantage; the laggard goes bankrupt.

### The Second Wave: Robotics After 2030

The first wave of AI automation—roughly 2023 to 2030—primarily affects cognitive and administrative work. But a second wave is building: physical automation through humanoid robotics and advanced manufacturing systems. This wave is rear-weighted toward the latter half of the decade and into the 2030s, but its foundations are being laid now.

**The Pivot Point:** The robotics industry is moving from pilot programmes to initial commercial viability. This transition marks the moment when the industry's path is decided; commercially meaningful at-scale deployment remains uncertain but probable.

| Company | Status | Scale Target |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| Tesla | Autonomous learning demonstrated | Mass production (Millions) |
| Agility Robotics | Commercial deployment | Logistics/Warehouse focus |
| Figure AI | Commercial pilots | Automotive partnership |
| BYD | Production scaling | Industrial integration |
| Boston Dynamics | Electric platform transition | R&D / Specialized utility |

Demonstrations have moved from programmed movements to generalised learning from observation. Industry analysts project the humanoid robotics market will reach substantial scale by 2035. By 2030, battery improvements should enable full-shift operation. The critical inflection point comes when humanoids cross from pilot programmes to large-scale deployment, likely first in automotive manufacturing, then in logistics and warehousing.

The implications compound the first wave's disruption. White-collar workers displaced in the first half of the decade cannot simply retrain for blue-collar work if those jobs are being automated in the second half.

## Part II: The New Oil—Energy, Data Centres, and AI Power

*Derived from: [Energy & Data Centers](global/trends/energy-and-data-centers.md) | [Data Center Capacity](global/data/data-center-capacity.md)*

If artificial intelligence is the transformative force of the coming decade, energy is its enabling substrate. Intelligence, in its artificial form, is electricity transformed through silicon. The nations that can provide abundant, reliable, affordable power for data centres will capture the productivity gains of the AI revolution.

Data centre capacity has become a critical resource for AI-era economic power. The United States maintains a dominant lead, possessing roughly half of the global installed capacity and hosting the most ambitious infrastructure projects.

**Mega-Projects:** The scale of investment has shifted from individual data centres to "Gigawatt-scale" campuses. Projects like the rumored "Stargate" and confirmed investments by hyperscalers represent capital commitments in the hundreds of billions of dollars, intended to bring tens of gigawatts of new capacity online. These are industrial infrastructure projects comparable to 20th-century electrification.

Europe, by contrast, trails significantly. Installed capacity is a fraction of American levels, and expansion is hamstrung by energy costs that are structurally higher than in the US or Asia.

---

## Part III: The Resource Dividend—Second-Order Winners

*Derived from: [Resource Dividend](global/trends/resource-dividend.md)*

As AI-powered economies accelerate, they consume more of everything: energy, metals, food, water. AI data centres require enormous quantities of copper, rare earths, and lithium. The semiconductor fabs that produce AI chips are among the most resource-intensive facilities ever built. This creates a second-order effect: resource-rich nations benefit from AI adoption elsewhere even if they capture none of the first-order gains.

The beneficiaries include Australia (critical minerals, uranium, LNG), Canada (hydroelectric power, minerals), Indonesia (40% of global nickel), Brazil (90%+ of global niobium, iron ore), and the Gulf states (converting oil wealth directly into compute infrastructure). These nations do not need to build AI systems—they need to supply the nations that do.

**The emerging pattern echoes the petrodollar system**—but with a critical difference. The petrodollar created mutual dependency; OPEC's 1973 embargo demonstrated real leverage. The resources-for-compute exchange is fundamentally lopsided. Resources are fungible commodities with multiple buyers. Compute access is concentrated in the US and China, specific to infrastructure and relationships, and trivially revocable. Australia can sell iron ore to China if the US relationship sours. But if the US revokes compute access—cuts cloud services, restricts AI models, sanctions chips—there is no alternative at comparable capability.

This asymmetry creates **stronger alignment pressure** than petrodollars ever did. Resource nations must maintain relationships with compute holders on the holders' terms. The data centres are in Virginia and Guizhou; the leverage flows toward them, not away. Saudi Arabia and UAE understand this—their massive AI investments are sovereignty projects, attempts to escape dependency on compute hegemons. For nations without sovereign wealth to build domestic infrastructure, the choice is starker: align with a compute hegemon or accept exclusion from AI productivity gains.

---

## Part IV: The Culture Variable—Adoption, Resistance, and Regulation

*Derived from: [Cultural Adoption](global/trends/cultural-adoption.md) | [AI Adoption Rates](global/data/ai-adoption-rates.md)*

Technology does not diffuse uniformly across societies. Cultural attitudes, institutional frameworks, and regulatory choices create dramatically different adoption trajectories. In the AI transition, these differences will prove decisive—not because regulation can prevent AI from existing, but because it determines whether a society captures or forfeits the gains.

### The Asian Adoption Advantage

Survey data consistently shows Asian societies adopting AI faster and more enthusiastically than Western counterparts. According to December 2025 surveys:

| Country | Enterprise Adoption | Citizen Optimism | "AI benefits > risks" |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| India | 92% | High | 74% |
| China | 50-58% | Very High | **83%** |
| Malaysia | — | 68% | — |
| Indonesia | — | 69% | 80% |
| Japan | 51% | 46% | — |
| United States | 9.7% (Census) | Low | **39%** |

**KPMG's 2025 global study** found 93% of Chinese employees use AI at work—versus 58% globally. The Edelman Trust Barometer shows 54% of Chinese "embrace AI use" versus only 17% of Americans—a **3x gap**.

The reasons are partly historical, partly structural. China experienced the most dramatic economic transformation in modern history, powered by successive waves of technology adoption—manufacturing automation, mobile payments, high-speed rail, electric vehicles. Each wave delivered visible benefits to ordinary citizens, building a cultural reservoir of technological optimism. There is also less cultural resistance to data collection and algorithmic decision-making; the collectivist orientation accepts what individualist cultures frame as privacy violations.

### American Paradoxes

The United States presents a paradox: the nation that creates AI is not the nation that adopts it fastest. US Census data (August 2025) shows only **9.7% of American businesses** actively using AI. McKinsey's November 2025 survey finds 88% of organizations experimenting with AI, but only **6% are "high performers"** capturing real value. Americans are more wary of AI than Chinese or Indian populations, particularly regarding data privacy and algorithmic decision-making.

Yet the paradox resolves in America's favour. What matters for national economic outcomes is not average adoption but frontier adoption—the productivity of the leading firms that compete globally. American technology companies are deploying AI at unprecedented scale; American data centres are expanding at rates that dwarf competitors; American capital is flowing into AI infrastructure at multiples of any other nation—**$109 billion in private investment in 2024 alone, nearly twelve times China's $9.3 billion**. The cultural wariness of middle America toward AI is economically irrelevant when the firms that generate American wealth are AI-native. The luddite tendencies of the median citizen are simply bypassed.

### European Regulatory Suicide

Europe has chosen a different path: the precautionary principle elevated to continental strategy. The EU AI Act, the most comprehensive AI regulation globally, mandates 'human oversight' for high-risk AI systems, requires extensive conformity assessments, and imposes substantial compliance burdens. Article 14 requires that AI systems be designed so that 'natural persons to whom human oversight is assigned' can monitor, interpret, and override AI decisions.

The actual effect is to impose costs on AI deployment that American and Chinese competitors do not bear. Every 'human in the loop' requirement adds latency, expense, and friction. Every conformity assessment delays deployment. Academic analysis already warns that the human oversight requirements risk becoming 'rubber stamp' procedures—fulfilling the letter of the law while adding no actual safety benefit. But the costs are real regardless of whether the benefits materialise.

Australia and Canada show signs of following the European model, driven by similar political cultures and regulatory instincts. The tragedy is that these regulations will likely arrive too late to achieve their stated goals and too early to avoid economic damage. By the time comprehensive AI regulation is fully implemented (EU high-risk system rules take effect in 2027), the AI landscape will have been shaped by American and Chinese deployment patterns. European, Australian, and Canadian firms will face the worst of both worlds: compliance costs that reduce competitiveness, combined with AI-enabled competition from firms that face no such constraints. The regulation will not stop AI; it will stop domestic AI.

## Part V: The Compression of Financial Services

*Derived from: [Financial Services Disruption](global/trends/financial-services-disruption.md) | [Financial Services Exposure](global/data/financial-services-exposure.md)*

Financial services face severe disruption, though the trajectory is compression and de-glamourisation rather than outright collapse. The industry has long positioned itself as the commanding height of the knowledge economy—the most sophisticated application of human cognitive ability to the management of capital. This self-conception is now badly dated.

At its core, much of finance is information processing: gathering data, identifying patterns, assessing risks, executing transactions. These functions are amenable to AI automation. Credit decisions that once required human judgment can be made by algorithms with greater accuracy and consistency. Trading strategies that once employed floors full of analysts can be implemented by systems that process information faster than any human. Compliance monitoring, fraud detection, customer service, back-office operations—the operational structure of a modern bank consists largely of tasks that artificial intelligence can perform more cheaply and reliably than human employees.

Simultaneously, alternative financial infrastructure erodes some of the traditional industry's moat. Stablecoins, decentralised finance protocols, and integrated payment systems demonstrate that certain core functions of banking—payments, some lending, basic asset custody—do not require the full institutional apparatus that incumbent banks have built.

**Yet outright collapse is unlikely.** Finance is not purely information processing; it is also:
- **Regulatory licenses and charters**: Banks exist partly because regulators permit them to; DeFi faces its own regulatory chokepoints (fiat on/off-ramps)
- **Liability and trust**: Wealthy clients pay for reputation, recourse, and accountability that algorithms alone don't provide
- **Distribution and relationships**: The advisory function—guiding clients, managing emotions, providing legitimacy—has value even when analytics are automated

The trajectory is compression, not collapse: a smaller, leaner, less glamorous industry. Employment contracts 30-50% from peak rather than disappearing entirely. Profits may remain respectable in absolute terms even as finance's share of GDP shrinks. The City of London employs fewer people but remains a financial centre; Singapore adapts to narrower niches rather than becoming irrelevant.

For nations heavily weighted toward financial services, this still represents serious challenge. The United Kingdom derives roughly fifteen to twenty percent of its GDP from financial and related professional services, with an even larger share of tax revenue. Singapore has built its city-state model on being Asia's neutral financial hub. A 30-50% compression of an industry that large still produces significant displacement and fiscal pressure—just not civilisational collapse.

## Part VI: The Contraction of Higher Education

*Derived from: [Higher Education Disruption](global/trends/higher-education-disruption.md)*

The university system faces severe disruption, though the framing requires nuance. Higher education has operated on an implicit bargain for decades: students pay substantial sums (or states subsidise them) in exchange for credentials that unlock professional employment. Artificial intelligence disrupts both sides of this bargain—but not uniformly, and not overnight.

The knowledge transmission function of universities—lectures, readings, problem sets, examinations—can increasingly be delivered by AI systems with greater personalisation, infinite patience, and near-zero marginal cost. A student seeking to understand corporate finance, organic chemistry, or constitutional law can receive instruction calibrated precisely to their level, available at any hour, responsive to their specific confusions.

**Yet universities provide more than knowledge transmission.** They also provide:
- **Socialisation and networks**: Mating markets, friendship formation, professional connections
- **Physical infrastructure**: Labs, studios, clinical facilities, athletic programs
- **Status rituals**: Graduation ceremonies, alumni networks, institutional prestige
- **Credentialing inertia**: Professional orders (medicine, law, engineering) require degrees by regulation

These functions can be unbundled, but institutions that own the physical real estate and brand can adapt by re-weighting toward them. The university experience may evolve rather than disappear.

The credentialing function faces more direct assault. Professional employers historically used university degrees as screening mechanisms—signalling intelligence, conscientiousness, and baseline capability. AI disrupts this from both directions: direct competency assessment becomes possible, while AI automation eliminates many of the professional roles that degrees previously unlocked. But regulatory requirements for degrees in licensed professions change slowly. Courts, medical boards, and engineering councils are deeply tied into degree requirements—changing that is slow, political work.

**The trajectory is bifurcated contraction, not uniform collapse.**

- **Elite research universities** (top ~100 globally): Retain value through network formation, research infrastructure, ultra-selective signalling. May actually concentrate prestige as mid-tier competitors fail.
- **Mid-tier universities** (vast middle): Face existential crisis from both AI disruption and pre-existing demographic/fiscal pressures. Many will close, merge, or radically downsize. But attribution is tricky—is this AI, or declining birth rates, or state funding cuts?
- **Professional schools**: Varied by field. Medical schools retain value (physical skills); law and business schools face more pressure.
- **Community colleges and vocational**: May actually expand if retraining becomes essential.

The employment implications ripple outward. Universities are major employers in many regions. University towns that built economies around student populations face structural adjustment. By 2035, the university sector likely employs significantly fewer people—but "half the current workforce" may overstate the AI-specific effect versus demographic and fiscal pressures already in motion.

## Part VII: The Legitimacy Crisis

*Derived from: [Legitimacy Crisis](global/trends/legitimacy-crisis.md)*

Economic disruption alone does not produce political instability. Japan has endured three decades of stagnation without civil unrest; Italy has muddled through chronic dysfunction; even the Great Depression, for all its misery, produced more resignation than revolution in most of the affected countries. What transforms economic stress into political crisis is the collapse of legitimacy—the withdrawal of consent from institutions that can no longer justify their authority.

The Western democracies have been haemorrhaging legitimacy for a generation. Trust in government, media, religious institutions, and professional expertise has declined to historic lows. This decline reflects genuine failures: wars launched on false pretences, financial crises met with elite bailouts, pandemic responses that oscillated between incompetence and overreach, immigration policies imposed against popular opposition, and a pervasive sense that the rules apply differently to the connected and the common.

Academic researchers studying civil conflict have identified several Western nations as displaying structural preconditions for serious unrest: extreme polarisation, loss of institutional legitimacy, identity-based factionalism, and perceptions among significant population segments that the system operates against their interests. Whether Western institutional resilience—historically robust—can absorb the coming economic shock, or whether the combination of AI-driven displacement, pre-existing legitimacy deficits, and demographic transformation proves too much, is the central political question of the coming decade.

## Part VIII: A Taxonomy of Outcomes

*Derived from: [Winners and Losers](global/analysis/winners-and-losers.md) | Regional and Country Analyses*

Against this backdrop, we can sketch the trajectories of specific nations through the coming decade. These projections assume the displacement thesis, incorporate data centre capacity as a proxy for AI economic power, and account for cultural and regulatory dispositions toward adoption. A critical analysis must acknowledge uncertainty: the future is not predetermined, and countries can adapt in ways that confound prediction. What follows is a structured assessment of probabilities, not a prophecy.

### The Winners

**[United States](regions/north-america/united-states/):** The dominant beneficiary of the AI transition. American firms created the foundational models; American capital finances their deployment; American energy powers the data centres; the dollar remains the global reserve currency because there is no alternative. With 53.7 gigawatts of installed capacity—44% of global total—and the $500 billion Stargate project adding significant capacity, the United States will generate and capture AI value at scales no competitor can match. The cultural wariness of middle America toward AI is economically irrelevant when the frontier firms that generate American wealth are AI-native. *Growth outlook: high.*

**[China](regions/asia-pacific/china/):** Aggressive AI adoption regardless of social cost, backed by state capacity to suppress dissent and direct economic restructuring. Survey data shows 93% of Chinese employees use AI at work versus 17% of Americans who "embrace AI"—a cultural disposition toward technology adoption built from decades of visible technological benefit. With substantial capacity and state‑directed investment, China possesses the infrastructure to remain competitive. Demographic decline and the Taiwan risk cloud the trajectory, but the Party's willingness to absorb short‑term pain for strategic advantage gives China options unavailable to democratic competitors. *Growth outlook: high (risk‑weighted).* 

Also positioned as winners: [Saudi Arabia](regions/middle-east/saudi-arabia/) (converting oil wealth to AI infrastructure at $100 billion scale), [UAE](regions/middle-east/uae/) (regional AI hub with governance credibility), [Poland](regions/europe/poland/) (Europe's surprising success—less exposed to services automation, manufacturing growth, ideological independence), [Australia](regions/asia-pacific/australia/) (critical minerals and energy advantaged, contingent on regulatory choices).

### The Restructured

**[Canada](regions/north-america/canada/):** A case study in state‑capital fusion that defies simple categorisation. The federal state is being refitted into an investment platform whose primary function is removing risk from large projects so global and domestic institutional capital can own the resulting assets. The Building Canada Act and Major Projects Office have assembled major pipelines in LNG, SMRs, and mines; UAE investment protection agreements shield Gulf sovereign capital. Resources will be developed; the question is who captures the gains—and whether citizens interact with backbone infrastructure primarily as payers over decades. The services economy in Toronto and Vancouver faces the same AI displacement as anywhere; the resource economy may boom. *Growth outlook: moderate (uneven/concentrated).* 

Also restructuring: [Argentina](regions/south-america/argentina/) (Milei reforms creating winners and losers within a transforming economy).

### The Survivors

**[Japan](regions/asia-pacific/japan/):** Will manage decline with characteristic dignity. Already the most automated major economy, Japan will neither lead nor collapse. Conservative AI adoption—only 46% citizen optimism, 19% workplace usage—means less disruption but also less growth. Demographic decline caps dynamism, but the absence of significant unassimilated populations means AI‑driven unemployment will not compound into political crisis. Japan demonstrates that managed decline is viable: not catastrophic, not dynamic, but stable. *Growth outlook: moderate.*

**[Singapore](regions/asia-pacific/singapore/):** Will adapt because Singapore always adapts—but the landing zone is smaller than it once appeared. Financial services face full‑force AI automation, and the city‑state's value proposition as neutral intermediary becomes less valuable in a world of AI‑enabled decentralisation. DBS has deployed 800 AI models generating S$1 billion in impact; the government committed S$27 billion to AI strategy. Singapore's technocratic elite understands the threat. Infrastructure constraints (grid at capacity, limited expansion room) mean Singapore must compete on governance quality, not compute scale. *Growth outlook: moderate.*

**[Brazil](regions/south-america/brazil/):** Commodity advantages and continental scale provide buffer against AI disruption. Neither positioned to capture major gains nor structured to fracture—the classic survivor profile of resource wealth, institutional resilience, and limited services exposure enabling muddling through.

Also surviving: [South Korea](regions/asia-pacific/south-korea/), [Netherlands](regions/europe/netherlands/) (ASML strategic chokepoint, 95% AI adoption, logistics hub), [Indonesia](regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/) (resources and scale, but infrastructure/energy gaps limit AI capture), [Spain](regions/europe/spain/), [Portugal](regions/europe/portugal/), [Israel](regions/middle-east/israel/) (war-contingent).

### The Declining

**[Germany](regions/europe/germany/):** In its third consecutive year of recession—the longest since reunification—with the BDI describing "the greatest crisis in post‑war history." Electricity costs three to four times US levels make competitive data centre expansion difficult. The manufacturing base is pressured by energy costs and Chinese EV competition; software culture is limited; the political class remains constrained by energy transition commitments. Political realignment is coming—the AfD will eventually govern or force fundamental coalition shifts—but will inherit structural decline with no obvious recovery path. This is not cyclical recession but structural repositioning downward. *Growth outlook: low/negative.*

**[Switzerland](regions/europe/switzerland/):** Economy heavily weighted toward financial services, private banking, and high‑end professional services—precisely the sectors most vulnerable to AI automation and alternative finance disruption. The private banking model is eroding: secrecy advantages gone, relationship managers replaced by AI, wealth moving to crypto custody. Pharmaceutical and precision manufacturing provide buffer but may not fully offset. *Growth outlook: low/negative.*

**[Russia](regions/europe/russia/):** Sanctions isolation, brain drain, and technology cutoff combine with demographic collapse. Energy revenues sustain the state but cannot power modernisation. Structural decline without the social fracturing visible in Western Europe—repressive capacity maintains order as the economy contracts.

Also declining: [Italy](regions/europe/italy/), [Philippines](regions/asia-pacific/philippines/) (BPO economy collapsing—100% of call center jobs disappearing within 3-5 years; broader BPO follows), [Nigeria](regions/africa/nigeria/) (youngest major population with 93% informal economy; demographic liability), [Egypt](regions/middle-east/egypt/) (debt trap—60% of spending on interest; Suez vulnerability), [South Africa](regions/africa/south-africa/) (load shedding caps growth; 32%+ unemployment), [Pakistan](regions/asia-pacific/pakistan/) (24th IMF programme; structural dysfunction).

### The Contested

These nations face genuinely uncertain futures—high variance outcomes where the determining factors cannot be confidently forecast.

**[Ireland](regions/europe/ireland/):** The pessimistic thesis holds that Ireland combines maximum economic exposure—American tech headquarters attracted by tax arbitrage, financial services back‑office operations—with Dublin's data centre grid at capacity. The optimistic counter: Ireland has been remarkably stable since 1998, the economy is more diversified than recognised (1,800+ multinationals across pharma, medtech, technology), and small nations pivot faster than large ones. Ireland has reinvented itself repeatedly since the 1980s. *Growth outlook: uncertain (high variance).*

Also contested: [Vietnam](regions/asia-pacific/vietnam/) (growth inflated by Chinese transshipment; 20% + 40% tariffs bite), [India](regions/asia-pacific/india/) (IT services vulnerable to AI; large population becomes liability when labour is what AI replaces), [Mexico](regions/north-america/mexico/) (nearshoring potential vs tariff uncertainty and cartel violence), [Taiwan](regions/asia-pacific/taiwan/) (TSMC makes 92% of advanced chips; China risk dominates all other factors), [Malaysia](regions/asia-pacific/malaysia/) (semiconductor positioning vs structural challenges), [Turkey](regions/europe/turkey/) (geopolitical positioning between blocs creates opportunity and risk), [Thailand](regions/asia-pacific/thailand/) (digital/EV strength offset by structural weaknesses and high household debt).

### The Fracturing

**[United Kingdom](regions/europe/united-kingdom/):** The central case for Western fracture. Every vulnerability compounds: services economy exposed to automation; financial services disrupted by AI and alternative finance; limited ability to expand compute infrastructure; no manufacturing base; few technology firms capturing AI gains; housing crisis; legitimacy haemorrhaging for a generation. The economic cushion that purchased acquiescence shrinks with City tax revenues. Something like the Troubles—wider in scope, less structured in organisation—becomes plausible. Scotland may exit. *Growth outlook: negative with instability risk.*

**[France](regions/europe/france/):** Combines economic decline with serious civil unrest risk. Nuclear energy could power AI infrastructure, but the political system struggles to deploy that advantage. Large public‑sector exposure to automation; fiscal stress collides with union power. The banlieues risk becoming ungovernable. A Le Pen‑type figure may take power but inherit fiscal strain and social unrest. *Growth outlook: negative with instability risk.*

### The Collapsing

**[Iran](regions/middle-east/iran/):** Currency collapse; high inflation; capital flight; frequent blackouts. Half of industry has halted due to power failures. Sanctions have resumed with bipartisan US support. This is structural state failure, not cyclical pressure. While regional competitors invest in AI, Iran cannot keep the lights on. *Growth outlook: severe contraction.*

Also collapsing: [Venezuela](regions/south-america/venezuela/) (state failure already advanced).

## Part IX: The View from 2036

*Derived from: [View from 2035](global/analysis/view-from-2035.md) | [Actionable Implications](global/analysis/actionable-implications.md)*

By 2036, the map of power and prosperity will look nothing like 2020. The United States will have consolidated its position as the world's dominant economy, its AI companies generating wealth at scales that dwarf the oil fortunes of the twentieth century. American political instability—and there will be instability—will not derail the underlying technological and economic transformation. The dollar will remain the reserve currency because there is no alternative.

Asia will have demonstrated that cultural disposition toward technology adoption matters. China, India, and Southeast Asian nations that embraced AI will have captured productivity gains while Europe debated regulations. The humanoid robotics wave, arriving in force after 2030, will have begun its transformation of physical labour—initially in automotive and logistics, eventually spreading to service sectors.

Europe will have demonstrated that regulatory frameworks cannot fully protect against technologies they cannot contain. The EU AI Act and its human oversight requirements will have imposed costs without preventing AI deployment—often ensuring AI was deployed by non‑European competitors against European firms. The 'human in the loop' risks becoming the human holding the bag. Some nations—Poland, perhaps the Netherlands—will have adapted despite the regulatory environment. Others—Germany, France, the United Kingdom—may experience sustained decline absent adaptation.

Canada will have tested a different model: resource development enabled by state de-risking, owned by institutional capital, operated for decades under treaty-protected concessions. Whether this produces national prosperity broadly shared or a new form of rentier dependency will depend on choices made in the next five years. The infrastructure will be built; the question is whose balance sheet it sits on.

Financial centres will have hollowed out. London, Singapore, Zurich, Luxembourg, Dublin—each will have discovered that intermediation is a vulnerable position when AI can intermediate better and alternative finance can disintermediate entirely. The wealth that once flowed through these hubs will flow through algorithms and protocols instead, captured by those who build the systems rather than those who operate them.

The professional-managerial class that has governed Western societies since the mid-twentieth century will have been economically devastated and politically discredited. The very people whose jobs were to run things—to administer, regulate, manage, and communicate—will have discovered that artificial intelligence can run things better and cheaper. Their ideology will persist in institutional residue, but their material base will have collapsed. What replaces them—whether populist nationalism, technocratic authoritarianism, or something not yet visible—will shape the politics of the 2030s and beyond.

For individuals navigating this transition, the implications are stark. Geographic mobility matters: being in the wrong country as it fractures is not a recoverable error. Asset diversification matters: having resources in multiple jurisdictions provides resilience against localised collapse. Clear-eyed assessment matters: normalcy bias—the assumption that tomorrow will resemble today—is the most dangerous cognitive error in a period of discontinuous change.

The falcon is already beyond recall. The widening gyre has begun.
